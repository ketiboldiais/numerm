						<h3>Preface</h3>
						<p>Here, we review basic algebra skills necessary for higher level mathematics. The skills presented here are akin to elementary-level reading comprehension in mathematics, so it is absolutely critical that we have them down pat before moving any further. Before we proceed, some terminology.</p>
						<p>For addition, the following terms are available for use:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>${\text{term} + \text{term} = \text{sum}}$</li>
							<li>${\text{summand} + \text{summand} = \text{sum}}$</li>
							<li>${\text{addend} + \text{addend} = \text{sum}}$</li>
							<li>${\text{augend} + \text{addend} = \text{sum}}$</li>
						</ul>
						<p>For subtraction:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>${\text{term} - \text{term} = \text{difference}}$</li>
							<li>${\text{minuend} - \text{subtrahend} = \text{difference}}$</li>
						</ul>
						<p>For multiplication:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>${\text{factor} \times \text{factor} = \text{product}}$</li>
							<li>${\text{multiplier}(\text{multiplicand}) = \text{product}}$</li>
						</ul>
						<p>For division:</p>
						<ul>

					<!-- Properties of Reals -->
					<h4>Properties of Real Numbers</h4>
					<p>The fundamental properties of real numbers are the rules grounding algebraic manipulation. From these properties, we can derive a wide variety of mathematical results.</p>
					
					<!-- Commutative Properties -->
						<p><span class="topic">The Commutative Properties.</span> The commutative properties allow us to ignore <span class="italicsText">order</span>.</p>

						<div class="rule">
							<p><span class="topic">Commutative Property of Addition.</span> Given ${a \in \R}$ and ${b \in \R,}$</p>
							<figure class="math-display">
								<div>
									<p>${a + b = b + a}$</p>
								</div>
							</figure>
							<p>I.e., real numbers may be added in any <span class="italicsText">order</span> without affecting the sum.</p>
						</div>

						<p>We can see that the commutative property of addition is by adding any real numbers: ${2 + 7 = 7 + 2 = 9;}$ ${1 + 2 + 3 = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.}$ The commutative property of addition essentially allows us to move addends as needed.</p>

						<div class="rule">
							<p><span class="topic">Commutative Property of Multiplication.</span> Given ${a \in \R}$ and ${b \in \R,}$</p>
							<figure class="math-display">
								<div>
									<p>${(a)(b) = (b)(a)}$</p>
								</div>
							</figure>
							<p>I.e., real numbers may be multiplied in any <span class="italicsText">order</span> without affecting the sum.</p>
						</div>

						<p>Here too the commutative property of multiplication is apparent by multiplying any real numbers: ${4 \times 5 = 5 \times 4 = 20;}$ ${(2)(4)(3) = (4)(3)(2) = 24.}$ The commutative property of multiplication allows us to move factors as needed; a particular useful property for quick computation.</p>

						<p><span class="exh">Exercise.</span> Compute ${1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + 98 + 99 + 100.}$</p>

						<details class="answer">
							<summary>Solution</summary>
							<p>There are 100 terms in this problem. The first term can be paired and added with the last term, the second term with the second to last, the third with the third to last, etc.: ${(1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + (3 + 98) \ldots + (49 + 52) + (50 + 51).}$ Each of these pairs sums to 101. There are 50 pairs total, so the sum is: ${50 \cdot 101 = 5050.}$ This computation is attributed to the great mathematician Karl Gauss while he was a schoolboy.</p>
						</details>

					<!-- Associative Properties -->
						<p><span class="topic">The Associative Properties.</span> Where the commutative properties allow us to ignore <span class="italicsText">order</span>, the associative properties allow us to ignore <span class="italicsText">grouping.</span></p>
						
						<p>The <span class="term">associative property of addition</span> allows us to group addends however way we please to arrive at the sum.</p>

						<div class="rule">
							<p><span class="topic">Associative Property of Addition.</span> Given ${a \in \R,}$ ${b \in \R,}$ and ${c \in \R:}$</p>
							<figure class="math-display">

									<p>${a + b + c = (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)}$</p>
								</div>
							</figure>
							<p>I.e., real numbers may be added in any <span class="italicsText">grouping</span> without affecting the sum.</p>
						</div>

						<p>We can think of the associative property as the <span class="italicsText">sweet milk-coffee property</span>. If we want sweet milk-coffee, we can add the sugar and coffee then the milk, or the coffee and the milk then the sugar:</p>

						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>(sugar + coffee) + milk = sugar + (coffee + milk)</p>
							</div>
						</figure>

						<p><span class="exh">Exercise.</span> Compute ${357 + 17999 + 1}$ without paper and pencil.</p>

									</ul>
								</div>
							</div>
						</details>

						<p>Similarly, the <span class="term">associative property of multiplication</span> allows us to place factors in whatever arrangement we would like to arrive at the product. The commutative and associated properties only apply to addition and multiplication. They <span class="underlineText">do not apply</span> to division and subtraction.</p>

						<div class="rule">
							<p><span class="topic">Associative Property of Multiplication.</span> Given ${a \in \R,}$ ${b \in \R,}$ and ${c \in \R:}$</p>
							<figure class="math-display">
								<div>
									<p>${abc = (ab)c = a(bc)}$</p>
								</div>
							</figure>
							<p>I.e., real numbers may be multiplied in any <span class="italicsText">grouping</span> without affecting the product.</p>
						</div>

					<!-- Distributive Property -->
						<p><span class="topic">The Distributive Property.</span> The <span class="term">distributive property</span> provides that the product of a factor times a sum is the sum of the factor times the addends of the sum. This property is unique in that it addresses two operations, multiplication and addition.</p>

						<div class="rule">
							<p><span class="topic">Distributive Property.</span> Given ${a \in \R,}$ ${b \in \R,}$ and ${c \in \R:}$</p>
							<figure class="math-display">
								<div>
									<p>${a(b + c) = ab + ac}$</p>
								</div>
							</figure>
						</div>

						<p><span class="exh">Exercise.</span> Compute ${1001 \cdot 20}$ without paper and pencil.</p>
						<details class="answer">
							<summary>Solution</summary>
							<p>${1001 \cdot 20 = 20(1000 + 1)}$</p>
							<p>${\phantom{1001 \cdot 20} = 20,000 + 20}$</p>
							<p>${\phantom{1001 \cdot 20} = 20,020}$</p>
						</details>

						<p>The distributive law is effectively a rule for removing parentheses. It is the governing rule of expansion. Consider the following:</p>

						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>${(a + b)(m + n)}$</p>
							</div>
						</figure>

						<p>Suppose ${c = (m + n).}$ Then:</p>

						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>${c(a + b) = ac + bc}$</p>
								<p>${\phantom{c(a + b)} = ac + bc}$</p>
								<p>${\phantom{c(a + b)} = a(m + n) + b(m + n)}$</p>
								<p>${\phantom{c(a + b)} = am + an + bm + bn.}$</p>
							</div>
						</figure>

					<!-- Identity Properties -->
						<p><span class="topic">Identity Properies.</span> The identity properties tell us that there are two unique numbers, <span class="italicsText">identities</span>, that when added or multiplied to the the original number, return the original number.</p>

						<div class="rule">
							<p><span class="topic">Identity Property of Addition.</span> Given ${a \in \R,}$ there exists a unique number called the <span class="italicsText">additive identity</span>, 0, such that:</p>
							<figure class="math-display">
								<div>
									<p>${a + 0 = a.}$</p>
								</div>
							</figure>
						</div>

						<div class="rule">
							<p><span class="topic">Identity Property of Multiplication.</span> Given ${a \in \R,}$ there exists a unique number called the <span class="italicsText">multiplicative identity</span>, 1, such that:</p>
							<figure class="math-display">
								<div>
									<p>${a \cdot 1 = 1.}$</p>
								</div>
							</figure>
						</div>

					<!-- Inverse Properties -->
						<p><span class="topic">Inverse Properties.</span> The inverse properties provide that when we add a number to a special number called its <span class="italicsText">additive inverse</span>, we get back the number's additive identity (0), and if we multiply a number to a special number called its <span class="italicsText">multiplicative inverse</span>, we get back the number's multiplicative identity (1).</p>
						<div class="rule">
							<p><span class="topic">Inverse Property of Addition.</span> Given ${a \in \R,}$ there exists a unique number ${-a}$ called the <span class="italicsText">additive inverse</span>, such that:</p>
							<figure class="math-display">
								<div>
									<p>${a + (-a) = 0.}$</p>
								</div>
							</figure>
						</div>
						<p>For example, the additive inverse of ${-1}$ is ${1.}$ This property leads to a special characteristic of the number 0. The number 0 is the only number whose additive inverse is itself.</p>
						<div class="rule">
							<p><span class="topic">Inverse Property of Multiplication.</span> Given ${a \in \R,}$ there exists a unique number ${1/a,}$ called the <span class="italicsText">multiplicative inverse</span>, such that:</p>
							<figure class="math-display">
								<div>
									<p>${a \cdot \dfrac{1}{a} = 1}$</p>
								</div>
							</figure>
						</div>
						<p>The multiplicative inverse is also called the <span class="italicsText">reciprocal</span>. The inverse property of multiplication allows us to conclude: ${a\left(\frac{1}{a}\right) = 1.}$ Again, this property leads to a special characteristic of the number 0. The number 0 is the only real number with no multiplicative inverse.</p>

				<section id="ratios" class="grid-item">
					<!-- Ratios Intro -->
						<h4>Ratios</h4>

						<p>The <span class="term">ratio</span> of two quantities tells us the relative <span class="italicsText">sizes</span> of the quantities. For example, if we say, "There were 3 bachelors for every 5 bachelorettes," are expressing the ratio:</p>

						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>${\dfrac{\text{bachelors}}{\text{bachelorettes}} = \dfrac{3}{5} = 3:5}$</p>
							</div>
						</figure>

						<p>The use of a colon is often helpful when expressing the relative sizes of the quantities of multiple discrete objects: The sentence, "For every 1 house on Main Street, there are 2 cats and 100 mice," may be expressed as: ${1:2:100.}$</p>

										<details class="answer">
											<summary>Solution</summary>
			
											<p>Remember, a ratio tells us nothing about the actual sizes of the sets. It only gives us <span class="italicsText">relative sizes</span>. Thus, we know that:</p>

									<p><span class="exh">Exercise.</span> The ratio of papayas to mangoes to rambutans in the fruit basket is 2:3:30. Only papayas, mangoes, and rambutans comprise the fruit basket.</p>
									<ol>
										<li>What is the number of mangoes to the number of fruits in the fruit basket?</li>
										<details class="answer">
											<summary>Solution</summary>
											<p>From the ratio, we know that there are at least 2 papayas, 3 mangoes, and 30 rambutans. Thus, there ${2 + 3 + 30 = 35}$ total fruits. Hence:</p>
											<figure class="math-display">
												<div>

											</figure>
										</details>

										<li>Suppose there are 385 fruits in the fruit basket. How many mangoes are there?</li>
										<details class="answer">
											<summary>Solution</summary>
											<p>The ratio of mangoes to fruits is ${\dfrac{3}{35}.}$ Thus, we have:</p>

									<p><span class="exh">Exercise.</span> Shylock has a jewel box filled with only emeralds and rubies. The ratio of emeralds to the total number of jewels in the box is ${2:5.}$ If Shylock adds 4 emeralds and removes 10 rubies, there will be twice as many emeralds in the box as rubies. How many jewels were in the box originally?</p>
									<details class="answer">
										<summary>Solution</summary>
										<p>Let ${e}$ be the number of emeralds, ${r}$ the number of rubies, and ${t}$ the total number of jewels. We know that the box consists only of emeralds and rubies, so:</p>
										<figure class="math-display">
											<div>
												<p>${e + r = t}$</p>
											</div>
										</figure>
										<p>Thus, the original ratio of emeralds to jewels can be expressed as:</p>
										<figure class="math-display">
											<div>
												<p>${\dfrac{e}{e + r} = \dfrac{2}{5}}$</p>
												<p>${5e = 2(e + r)}$</p>
												<p>${5e = 2e + 2r}$</p>
												<p>${3e = 2r}$</p>
											</div>
										</figure>
										<p>Next, we are told that if Shylock adds 4 emeralds and removes 10 rubies, there are twice as many emeralds in the box as there are rubies. This statement expresses a ratio:</p>
										<figure class="math-display">
											<div>
												<p>${\dfrac{e + 4}{r - 10} = \dfrac{2}{1} = 2}$</p>
											</div>
										</figure>
										<p>Once more, we can express this ratio as a linear equation:</p>
										<figure class="math-display">
											<div>
												<p>${\dfrac{e + 4}{r - 10} = \dfrac{2}{1} = 2}$</p>
												<p>${2(r - 10) = e + 4}$</p>
												<p>${2r - 20 = e + 4}$</p>
											</div>
										</figure>
										<p>We know ${2r = 3e,}$ so we can substitute:</p>
										<figure class="math-display">
											<div>
												<p>${3e - 20 = e + 4}$</p>
												<p>${2e = 24}$</p>
												<p>${e = 12}$</p>
											</div>
										</figure>
										<p>Since ${e = 12,}$ we know there are ${r = \dfrac{3e}{2} = \dfrac{3(12)}{2} = \dfrac{36}{2} = 18}$ rubies. Thus, there are ${e + r = 12 + 18 = 30}$ jewels in the box.</p>

									<details class="answer">
										<summary>Solution</summary>
										<p>Suppose ${a}$ is the number of lawyers against the merger, and ${t}$ is the total number of lawyers. Thus, we have the following ratio:</p>

										<figure class="math-display">
											<div>
												<p>${\dfrac{a}{t} = \dfrac{9}{11}}$</p>
											</div>
										</figure>

										<p>Since there are exactly 18 lawyers who recommend against the merger, there are ${t - 18}$ lawyers who recommend the merger. Thus:</p>

										<figure class="math-display">
											<div>
												<p>${\dfrac{t - 18}{t} = \dfrac{9}{11}}$</p>

										<p>Now we merely must solve for ${t:}$</p>

									<details class="answer">
										<summary>Solution</summary>
										<p>We know there are 27 green pills. For every 3 of those pills, there is 1 red pill. Thus, there are ${27 / 3 = 9}$ red pills. Then, for every 1 red pill, there are 5 blue pills. Thus, there are ${9 \cdot 5 = 45}$ blue pills. The total number of pills then is:</p>
										<figure class="math-display">
											<div>
												<p>${9 + 45 + 27 = 81}$ total pills.</p>
											</div>
										</figure>
										<p>Alternatively, we know that with just the ratio, there are ${1 + 5 + 3 = 9}$ total pills. Hence, the ratio of green pills to total pills is ${3/9 = 1/3.}$ Suppose ${t}$ is the total number of pills in the bag. Because there are 27 green pills total, we have:</p>
										<figure class="math-display">
											<div>

What is Dracula's shortest height?</p>
									<details class="answer">
										<summary>Solution</summary>
										<p>There are four heights total. We denote each with ${h_1,}$ ${h_2,}$ ${h_3,}$ and ${h_4.}$ We thus have the following ratios:</p>

												<p>${\dfrac{h_1}{h_4} = \dfrac{16}{1}}$</p>
											</div>
										</figure>
										<p>Since ${h_1 : h_2}$ is ${24 : 5,}$ we know that ${h_2 : h_1}$ is ${5 : 24.}$ This means that ${h_2}$ is ${5/24}$ of ${h_1.}$</p>
										<figure class="math-display">
											<div>
												<p>${h_2 = \dfrac{5}{24}h_1}$</p>

										<figure class="math-display">
											<div>
												<p>${h_3 = 12h_2 = 12 \left( \dfrac{5}{24} \right)}$</p>

					<!-- Percentages Intro -->
					<h4>Percent</h4>
					<p>The word <span class="term">percent</span> is likely an abbreviation for the pseudo-Latin <span class="italicsText">per centum</span>, meaning &#8220;per hundred.&#8221; Denoted by the ${\%,}$ a percent is a shorthand for ${n/100,}$ where ${n}$ ${n \in \R.}$ Thus, ${1/4 = 25/100 = 25\%.}$</p>
					<div class="compare">
						<div>
							<p><span class="exh">Exercise.</span> What percent of 240 is 48?</p>
							<details class="answer">
								<summary>Solution</summary>
								<p>We solve for ${x}$:</p>
								<figure class="math-display">
									<div>
										<p>${240 (x/100) = 48}$</p>
										<p>${x/100 = 48/240}$</p>
										<p>${x = 100(48/240)}$</p>

										<p>${\phantom{x} = 480/24}$</p>
										<p>${\phantom{x} = 20}$</p>

								</figure>
								<p>Thus, ${48}$ is ${20\%}$ of ${240.}$ Of course, we could have found the percentage with simple arithmetic: ${48/240 = 0.2.}$ Then, multiplying ${0.2}$ by ${100,}$ we get ${20\%.}$ We used algebra first because it provides the appropriate approach for handling more complex percentage problems.</p>

					<p>When we increase a number ${x}$ by some percentage, we add the percent of ${x}$ to ${x}$ itself. For example, if we increase 100 by ${1\%}$, we increase 100 by 1, since ${1\%}$ of 100 is 1 &mdash; 101. Likewise, if we increase 100 by ${100\%,}$ we obtain 200, since ${100\%}$ of 100 is 100 ${(100 + 100 = 200.)}$</p>

				<section id="exponents" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Exponents</h4>
					<p>We can get by with the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division alone. However, having just these operations would be particularly cumbersome for many mathematical statements. Consider for example, the following expression:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${xxxxxxx + xxx}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>This is difficult to parse, and delimiting with parentheses and operator symbols is no better:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${(x)(x)(x)(x)(x)(x)(x) + (x)(x)(x)}$</p>
							<p>${x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x + x \cdot x \cdot x}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Even worse:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${xxxxxxx \times xxx = xxxxxxxxxx}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Because of this difficulty, we have the <span class="term">power operator</span>, providing the operation of <span class="term">exponentiation</span>:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${xxxxxxx + xxx = x^7 + x^3}$</p>
							<p>${xxxxxxx \times xxx = x^7 \times x^3 = x^{10}}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>From the multiplication example, we have the following rule:</p>
					<div class="rule">
						<p><span class="topic">Product Rule of Exponents.</span> For any ${a \in \R,}$ given ${m \in \N}$ and ${n \in \N:}$</p>
						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>${a^m a^n = a^{m + n}}$</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>Now, consider the following:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot a} = \dfrac{a^4}{a^5}}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Really, this reduces to:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${\dfrac{\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a}}{\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot a} = \dfrac{1}{a}}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>The computation above provides us two rules:</p>
					<div class="rule">
						<p><span class="topic">The Quotient Rule of Exponents.</span> For any ${a \in \R,}$ and ${m \in \N,}$ ${n \in \N,}$ such that ${m > n,}$</p>
						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>${\dfrac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m - n}}$</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<div class="rule">
						<p><span class="topic">The Negative Rule of Exponents</span>. For any ${a \in \R,}$ and ${n \in \N,}$</p>
						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>${a^{-n} = \dfrac{1}{a^n}}$</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>From the <span class="italicsText">Quotient Rule of Exponents</span>, we can observe:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a} = \dfrac{a^3}{a^3}}$</p>
							<p>${\dfrac{\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a}}{\cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a} \cdot \cancel{a}} = a^{3-3}}$</p>
							<p>${\phantom{\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a}} = a^0}$</p>
							<p>${\phantom{\dfrac{a \cdot a \cdot a}{a \cdot a \cdot a}} = 1}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Thus, we have the rule:</p>
					<div class="rule">
						<p><span class="topic">The Zero Exponent Rule.</span> For any ${\{a \in \R : a \neq 0 \},}$</p>
						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>${a^0 = 1.}$</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>*** The <span class="italicsText">Zero Exponent Rule</span> as applied to the number 0, ${0^0,}$ is a point of debate. Some mathematicians treat 0 as ${0^0 = 1.}$ In algebra and calculus, however, ${0^0 \implies \text{undefined}.}$ In computer science, programming languages handle ${0^0}$ in numerous different ways; some languages provide an explicit value (i.e., 1), others undefined, others return an error.</p>
					<p>Each approach has valid premises. If you consider ${x^y}$ as a function of two variables, then we have a problem with the definition ${0^0 = 1.}$ If we approach 0 along the line ${y = 0,}$ then following the definition, ${\lim\limits_{x \to 0^{+}} = 1.}$ However, if we approach 0 along the line ${x = 0,}$ then we get ${\lim\limits_{y \to 0^{y}} = \lim\limits_{y \to 0^{+}}0 = 0.}$ This would mean ${0^0 = 0.}$ Thus, continuous mathematics generally treats ${0^0 \implies \text{undefined}.}$</p>
					<p>On the other hand, discrete mathematics treats ${0^0 = 1.}$ In set theory, ${A^B}$ denotes the set of all functions from ${B}$ to ${A.}$ If ${A}$ and ${B}$ denote the cardinalities (i.e., the &#8220;size&#8221; of the sets) then ${A^B}$ is the size of the set of all functions from ${A}$ to ${B.}$ If we use the value 0 for ${A}$ and ${B,}$ then 0 denotes the empty set &mdash; ${0^0}$ is the collection of all functions from the empty set to the empty set. This is the <span class="italicsText">empty function</span>. There is one, and only one, empty function. Accordingly, ${0^0 = 1.}$ Thus, it must be true that ${0^0 = 1.}$</p>
					<p>Here, we will limit the <span class="italicsText">Zero Exponent Rule</span> to a number ${x}$ where ${\{ x \in \R : x \neq 0 \}.}$</p>
					<p>Next, consider the following example:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${(b^3)^2}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>This expression captures:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${(b \cdot b \cdot b ) \cdot (b \cdot b \cdot b)}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Following the associative property of multiplication:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${(b \cdot b \cdot b ) \cdot (b \cdot b \cdot b) = b \cdot b \cdot b \cdot b \cdot b \cdot b}$</p>
							<p>${\phantom{(b \cdot b \cdot b ) \cdot (b \cdot b \cdot b)} = b^6}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Again, we have another rule:</p>
					<div class="rule">
						<p><span class="topic">The Power Rule of Exponents.</span> For any ${a \in \R,}$ and ${m \in \N,}$ ${n \in \N,}$</p>
						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>${(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}}$</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>The commutative and associative properties of multiplication naturally lead to another rule. Consider the following:</p>
					<div class="mproof">
						<div class="premises">
							<ul>
								<li>${(ab)^3 = (ab) \cdot (ab) \cdot (ab)}$</li>
								<li>Expansion</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>${\phantom{(ab)^3} = a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot b \cdot b \cdot b}$</li>
								<li>Associative Property</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>${\phantom{(ab)^3} = (a \cdot a \cdot a) \cdot (b \cdot b \cdot b)}$</li>

							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>${\phantom{(ab)^3} = a^{3}b^{3}}$</li>
								<li>Definition of Exponent</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>Thus, it follows that:</p>
					<div class="rule">
						<p><span class="topic">The Power of a Product Rule of Exponents.</span> For all ${a, b \in \R,}$ given a ${n \in \N,}$</p>
						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>${(ab)^n = a^n b^n}$</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>This rule leads to another rule. Consider the expression ${(a^{-2}b^{2})^3.}$ Expanding and reducing this expression:</p>
					<div class="mproof">
						<div class="premises">
							<ul>
								<li>${(a^{-2}b^{2})^3 = \left(\dfrac{b^2}{a^2}\right)^3}$</li>

							<ul>
								<li>${\phantom{(a^{-2}b^{2})^3} = \left(\dfrac{b^2}{a^2}\right) \cdot \left(\dfrac{b^2}{a^2}\right) \cdot \left(\dfrac{b^2}{a^2}\right)}$</li>
								<li>Definition of Exponent</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>

								<li>The Negative Rule of Exponents</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>Hence, we have the rule:</p>

					<p><span class="topic">Rationalizing Radical Denominators.</span> Rational expressions can contain radicals in the denominator. These can be cumbersome to handle, and it is almost always best to simplify them.</p>
					<p>To remove radicals from the denominators of rational expressions, we multiply the radical expression by the form of 1 that will eliminate the radical. If the denominator contains a single term, we multiply the rational expression by its reciprocal. I.e., if the rational-radical expression is ${\dfrac{1}{b \sqrt{c}},}$ we multiply the expression by ${\dfrac{\sqrt{c}}{\sqrt{c}}.}$</p>

					<h3>Absolute Value</h3>
					<p>
						Let $x$ be a real number. The
						<span class="term">absolute value</span> of $x$ is the
						distance between $x$ and the origin. We denote the absolute value of
						$x$ with the notation: $\lvert x \rvert$
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, the numbers -8 and 8 are both 8 units from the origin.
						Thus, $\lvert 8 \rvert = 8$ and $\lvert -8 \rvert = 8$. We often use
						absolute value in equations:
					</p>
					<figure class="display-math">
						<div>
							<p>$5 - \lvert 6 - 7 \rvert = 5 - \lvert -1 \rvert$</p>
							<p>$\phantom{5 - \lvert 6 - 7 \rvert} = 5 - 1$</p>
							<p>$\phantom{5 - \lvert 6 - 7 \rvert} = 4$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Algebraically:</p>
					<figure>
						$$ \lvert x \rvert = \begin{cases} x &\text{ if } x \geq 0 \\ -x
						&\text{ if } x < 0 \end{cases} $$
					</figure>
					<p>
						For example, $\lvert -8 \rvert = -(-8) = 8$. From the definition of
						absolute value, we can make the following inferences:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>For all real numbers $x$:</li>
						<ul>
							<li><p>$\lvert x \rvert \geq 0$</p></li>
							<li>
								<p>$x \leq \lvert x \rvert$ and $-x \leq \lvert x \rvert$</p>
							</li>
							<li><p>${\lvert x \rvert}^2 = x^2$</p></li>
							<li><p>$\sqrt{x^2} = \lvert x \rvert$</p></li>
						</ul>
						<li>For all reall numbers $a$ and $b$:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									$\lvert ab \rvert = \lvert a \rvert \cdot \lvert b \rvert$
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									$\lvert \dfrac{a}{b} \rvert = \dfrac{\lvert a \rvert }{\lvert
									b \rvert }$
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									$\lvert a + b \rvert \leq \lvert a \rvert + \lvert b \rvert $
								</p>

				<section id="removing_absolute_value_symbols" class="grid-item">
					<p><span class="topic">Removing Absolute Value Symbols.</span> When we encounter expressions containing absolute values, it's often a good idea to rewrite the expression without the absolute value symbols.

					<p>The example above reveals useful insight. Suppose that real numbers are points along the real number line. Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers. Because $a$ and $b$ are points along a line, the distance between $a$ and $b$ is $a - b$.
