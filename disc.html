			<h2>Discrete Mathematics</h2>
			<p><span class="boldText">Discrete mathematics</span> is the mathematics of discrete and finite mathematical objects. Mathematical objects are abstract concepts &mdash; concepts like numbers, functions, triangles, matrices, groups, vector spaces, series, etc. Unlike what we might think of when we hear the word "object" &mdash; maybe a car, a table, or a molecule &mdash; mathematical objects are not physical. They do not move; they do not change over time; and they do not physically interact with real world entities.</p>
			<p>We can classify mathematical objects into two categories: (1) discrete (i.e., finite) and (2) continuous (i.e., infinite). Discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics separate from <span class="italicsText">continuous mathematics</span>, which concerns infinite, or continuous, mathematical objects. This difference might seem vague at the moment, but this is expected. The distinction can only be clarified with experience in both areas.</p>
			<p>All ideas in mathematics, discrete or continuous, are discovered<sup>1</sup> through <span class="boldText">logic</span>. Accordingly, a strong logic background is invaluable to any serious student of mathematics. As we study logic, we might find ourselves asking questions about knowledge and truth. Play with those questions. They are a strong indicator of encountering a link between philosophy and mathematics. Because these questions are excellent opportunities for deeper and playful thinking, the text will occassionally present difficult questions that may or may not have any clear answers.</p>
			<p class="fn"><sup>1</sup> Are mathematical ideas <span class="italicsText">discovered</span> or <span class="italicsText">created</span>?</p>

			<h3>Variables &amp; Statements</h3>

			<p><span class="topic">Variables.</span> In mathematics, we use <span class="boldText">variables</span> as placeholders, or temporary names. Variables allow us to both <span class="italicsText">abstract</span> problems and perform concrete computations of abstractions. For example: "Is there a number where tripling it and adding one is the same as squaring?" While this may seem verbose for some, it was how mathematics was done up until the 16th century &mdash; most everything was in prose. Queue the variable:</p>

			<figure>${ 3x + 1 = x^2 }$</figure>

			<p>The above equation reduces a string of 72 characters down to just 12, while retaining the original string's meaning. Variables are indispensible to mathematics and related fields like computer science.</p>

			<p>Some statements can be meaningfully assigned a true or false value. We call such statements &mdash; statements with a <span class="term">truth value</span> &mdash; <span class="term">propositions</span>. We denote propositions with lowercase letters &mdash; most commonly, ${p,}$ ${q,}$ ${r,}$ and ${s.}$ Formally:</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div class="rule">
					<p><span class="topic">Axiom.</span> There exists a class ${C}$ of statements of which we can assign one, and only one, of the words true and false. The members of this class are called propositions.</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>Some propositions are accepted as true without any further reason. We might call these "foundational assumptions;" the assumptions necessary for laying basic premises and further inferences. We call these propositions <span class="term">axioms</span>.</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div class="rule">
					<p><span class="topic">Definition.</span> An <span class="italicsText">axiom</span> is an initial proposition assumed to be true.</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>Axioms are a special subclass of propositions. All axioms are propositions, but more specifically, they are propositions whose truth values we do not know with certainty, but we assume them to be true.</p>

			
			<!-- <p><span class="topic">Universal Statements.</span>A <span class="boldText">universal statement</span> is a statement that claims: A certain property is true for all elements in a set.</p>
			<p>For example, "All negative numbers are less than 0." This is a universal statement. It states a property, "less than 0," is true for all elements in a set, "all negative numbers." Universal statements are used beyond mathematics as well. "All cats are mammals" is another example.</p>

			<p><span class="topic">Conditional Statements.</span> A <span class="boldText">conditional statement</span> is a statement that claims: <span class="underlineText">If</span> one thing is true, <span class="underlineText">then</span> some other thing must also be true.</p>
			<p>For example, the statement "If a number is divisible by 6, then it is also divisible by 3," is a conditional statement. We use conditional statements all the time: "If I do my homework, then I can play Madden."</p>

			<p><span class="topic">Existential Statements.</span> An <span class="boldText">existential statement</span> is a statement that claims, "There is at least one thing for which this property is true." That property may or may be true for <span class="italicsText">all</span> things, but the existential statement says, "Maybe not for all, but there is at least one."</p>
			<p>For example, "There is a prime number that is even." This is an existential statement, since it claims that there is at least one thing, "a prime number," for which the property, "is even", is true.  Another example: "Some people hate mayonnaise" is an existential statement, since it claims that there is <span class="italicsText">at lease one</span> person who hates mayonnaise.</p>

			<p><span class="topic">Universal Conditional Statements.</span> A <span class="boldText">universal conditional statement</span> is a statement that claims: "For all of these things, if this is true, then that is true." In other words, the <span class="italicsText">universal conditional</span> is a statement that is both conditional <span class="italicsText">and</span> universal.</p>
			<p>For example, "For all U.S. citizens, if a citizen is not at least 18, then the citizen cannot vote" is a universal conditional statement. It contains a universal statement, "For all U.S.  citizens," and a conditional, "if a citizen is not at least 18, then the citizen cannot vote."</p>

			<p><span class="topic">Universal Existential Statements.</span> A <span class="boldText">universal existential statement</span> is a statement that claims: "For all of these particular things, there is a property that is true for them."</p>
			<p>For example, the statement, "Every real number has an additive inverse" is a universal exisential statement. It claims that for all these particular things ("real numbers"), there is a property ("has an additive inverse"), that is true for them. Another example: "All humans need sleep." The statement is universal ("all humans"), and it asserts the existence of something ("sleep").</p>

			<p><span class="topic">Existential Universal Statements.</span> An <span class="boldText">existential universal statement</span> is a statement that claims: "There is a thing that satisfies a property for all things of a particular kind." The statement asserts existence (there is a thing), and it asserts universality (a property of <span class="italicsText">all</span> things).</p>
			<p>For example: "There is a positive integer that is less than or equal to every positive integer." This is an existential universal statement. Another example: "There is a chemical that is toxic to all people."</p> -->

			<h3>Set Theory</h3>

			<p>In mathematics, a <span class="boldText">set</span> is a collection of objects. Those objects might be dogs, people, trees, numbers, values, variables, or more abstractly, propositions. For example, the set of all coins includes nickels, sterling, and yen. The set of all countries includes Japan, Palau, and Uruguay. The set of all integers includes 1 and -117. We can visualize a set as:</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/set_intro.svg" alt="simple set" class="seventy-p" loading="lazy"/>
			</figure>

			<p>Sets can be finite (there are only so many countries), or infinite (there are infinitely many of numbers). Each object in a set is called a <span class="term">member</span> of that set.</p>

			<p><span class="topic">The Axiom of Extension.</span> The <span class="boldText">axiom of extension</span> provides that a set is completely determined by what its elements are &mdash; it is irrelevant whether the elements are in order, or whether an element is listed more than once.</p>
			<p>For example, the set $\{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ is the same as the set $\{ 2, 1, 3 \}$, and the same set as $\{ 2, 2, 3, 1 \}$.</p>

			<p><span class="topic">Subsets.</span> Some sets are themselves elements of another set. These sets are called <span class="boldText">subsets</span>. More formally:</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div class="rule">
					<p><span class="topic">Definition.</span> Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. The set $A$ is a <span class="italicsText">subset</span> of $B$ if, and only if, <span class="underlineText">every</span> element of $A$ is also an element of ${B.}$ To denote this relationship, we write:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${ A \subseteq B }$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>If ${A \subseteq B}$ is true, then we can infer: For every element ${x}$, if ${x \in A}$, then ${x \in B.}$ We describe ${A}$ and ${B's}$ relationship with statements such as "${A}$ is contained in $B$" and "${B}$ contains ${A.}$"</p>

			<p>If $A$ is not a subset of $B$, then we write:</p>

			<figure>$$ A \nsubseteq B $$</figure>

			<p>If $A \nsubseteq B$ is true, then we can infer: There is at least one element $x$ such that $x \in A$ and $x \notin B$. In other words, if $A$ is not a subset of $B$, then there is at least one element in $A$ that is not an element of B.</p>

			<p><span class="topic">Proper Subsets.</span> </p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div class="rule">
					<p><span class="topic">Definition.</span> Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ are sets. ${A}$ is a <span class="term">proper subset</span> of ${B}$ if, and only if, every element of ${A}$ is in ${B,}$ but there is at least one element in $B$ that is not in $A$. If $A$ is a proper subset of $B$, we write:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${ A \subset B }$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>If ${A \subset B}$ is true, we can infer: All of the elements of ${A}$ are elements of $B$, but there is at least one element of ${B}$ that is not an element of ${A.}$ We can also infer that all the elements of ${A}$ have some property in common that separate it from other subsets of ${B.}$</p>

			<p>If $A \subset B$ is false (i.e., $A$ is not a proper subset of $B$), we write:</p>
			
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${ A \not\subset B }$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>If $A \not\subset B$ is true, then either $A \not\subseteq B$ is true, or $A \subseteq B$ is true, but no elements in $B$ are not in $A$. </p>

			<p><span class="topic">Special Case: ${\emptyset.}$</span> By convention, the null set ${\emptyset}$ is a subset of every set, and is a proper subset of every set except itself (since the null set has no members).</p>

			<p><span class="topic">Set Notation.</span> To more efficiently discuss sets, mathematicians have come up with <span class="term">set notation</span>. Let's go over some of the most common notation.</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div class="rule">
					<p><span class="topic">Definition.</span> Suppose that ${S}$ is a set. The notation ${x \in S}$ means "${x}$ is an element of ${S}$."</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p>A set may be made more explicit through <span class="term">set roster notation</span>. For instance, $\{ 0, 1, 2 \}$ is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2. If the set has too many elements to list, ellipses may be used. For example, the set of all integers from 0 to 100 may be written as: $\{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots , 100 \}$. Likewise, the set of all positive integers may be written as $\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$.</p>

			<p>We can also specify sets in <span class="term">set builder notation</span>. Suppose that $S$ is a set, and $P(x)$ is a property that elements of $S$ may or may not satisfy. We can define a new set that contains all the elements of $S$ such that $P(x)$ is true:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${ \{ x \in S \mid P(x) \} }$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>The pipe character, |, is shorthand for "such that." Thus, above notation refers to all the elements of ${S}$ with the property $P(x)$. Note that in some mathematical contexts, the phrase "such that" is often abbreviated "s.t." or $\ni$. Thus, the above set may appear in some texts as:</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>$$ \{ x \in S \ni P(x) \}, \space \text{or} \\[1em] \{ x \in S \text{ s.t. } P(x) \} $$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<h4>Open Sentences</h4>
			<p>Consider the following:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${1 + x = 4}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>The above is clearly an equation, but more broadly, it is called an <span class="term">open sentence</span> &mdash; a statement that contains a variable, and becomes a proposition when an element of the universal set is substituted for the variable. In this case, the universal set is the set of all real numbers, ${\R.}$ If we substitute ${1,}$ an element of the universal set, into the variable, we obtain ${1 + 1 = 2,}$ a false proposition. But, if we instead substituted 3, another element of the universal set, we obtain ${1 + 3 = 4,}$ a true proposition.</p>
			<p>Like propostions, we denote open sentences with lower-case letters, with the one key difference &mdash; there is a subscript appended, corresponding to the variables used in the open sentence. For example, the open sentence above might be denoted ${p_x.}$</p>
			<p>The rule of substituting remains applicable for variables that occur more than once in the sentence:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${1 + x + x = 2}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>To return a true proposition for the sentence above, we must substitute a value into each ${x}$ in the open sentence.</p>
			<p>We call these statements open sentences because they are in fact sentences. Equations, at the end of the day, are simply sentences. The equation ${2x = 3}$ is just another way of saying, &#8220;Two multiplied by some value is three.&#8221; The use of the symbols 2, ${x,}$ ${=,}$ and ${3,}$ and arranging those symbols in a particular way, is nothing more than a means of making things more concise and easier to read. Mathematicians invent and use symbols because certain propositions cannot be expressed concisely and clearly in plain English:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div class="rule">
					<p>$$\int_0^{3.8}\frac{\pi^4 x y (a+9 c+8 b \cos(\frac{\pi z}{l})+18 c \cos(\frac{2 \pi z}{l})) \sin^2(\frac{\pi z}{l})}{l^4} dz$$</p>
					<p><span class="italicsText">&#8220;The ingegral with respect to ${z}$ from 0 to 3.8 of the quotient of the product of the product of the fourth power of Pi, ${x,}$ and ${y}$ multiplied by the sum of ${a,}$ the product of ${8,}$ ${b,}$ and the cosine of the quotient of the product of Pi and ${z}$ divided by ${l,}$ the product of ${18,}$ ${c,}$ and the cosine of the quotient of 2, Pi, and ${z,}$ and the square of the sine of the quotient of Pi and ${z}$ divided by ${l,}$ all divided by the the fourth power of ${l.}$&#8221;</span></p>

		<section id="ordered_pairs" class="grid-item">
			<h4>Ordered Pairs</h4>
			<p>When set theory was first introduced, it faced a major issue &mdash; how do you represent ordered pairs? The axiom of extension renders order irrelevant for defining sets. For example, $\{ a, b \}$ is the same set as $\{ b, a \}$. This is problematic if we are referring specifically to "$a$ then b", rather than "$b$ then $a$."</p>
			<p>The patch was to define ordered pairs as sets. An ordered pair is a set of the form $\{ \{ a \}, \{ a, b \} \}$. The set has two elements: $\{ a \}$ and $\{ a, b \}$. If $a \neq b$, then the two sets are distinct, and $a$ is in both sets but $b$ is not. With this definition, we can differentiate between $a$, and $b$. If $a = b$, then we can say that $a$ is both the first and second element of the pair.</p>
			<p>Eventually, however, mathematicians learned that writing $\{ \{ a \}, \{ a,b \} \mid a = b \}$ was too cumbersome. So, the syntax was shortened: $(a, b)$.</p>
			<p>Formalizing the discussion above: Let $a$ and $b$ be elements. The notation $(a, b)$ means the <span class="boldText">ordered pair</span> consisting of $a$ and $b$ together, such that $a$ is the first element of the pair and $b$ is the second element.</p>

			<p><span class="topic">Equality of Ordered Pairs.</span> Suppose $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ are ordered pairs. The ordered pairs are equal if, and only if, $a = c$ and $b = d$. Thus, the statement $(a, b) = (c, d)$ implies that $a = c$ and $b = d$.</p>

		<section id="relations" class="grid-item">
			<h3>Relations</h3>
			<p>As humans, we perceive the world according to the way things relate to one another. Corporate hierarchy, family relationships, friend networks, court systems, if-then, if-and-only-if, cause and effect, these are all relationships. Mathematical objects are no different &mdash; they too have relationships to other mathematical objects.  The set $A$ is related to the set $B$ if ${ A \subseteq B }$. The number $a$ is related to the number $b$ if ${ a < b }$, or if ${ a^2 + b^2 = 1 }$.</p>
			<p>In mathematics, if a mathematical object $x$ is related to a mathematical object ${y,}$ we write:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${ x \mathrel{R} y }$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>To denote "$x$ is related to $y$." If $x$ is not related to $y$, we write:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${x \not\mathrel{R} y }$.</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>For example, suppose we have two sets: ${A = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}}$ and ${B = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}}$. Suppose that an element ${a \in A}$ is related to an element ${b \in B}$, if, and only if, ${a < b}$. From this rule, we can infer: ${0 \mathrel{R} 1}$ since ${0 < 1}$; ${0 \mathrel{R} 2}$, since ${0 < 3}$; ${1 \mathrel{R} 2}$, since ${1 < 2}$; ${1 \mathrel{R} 3}$, since ${1 < 3}$; and ${2 \mathrel{R} 3}$ since ${2 < 3}$. But: ${1 \not\mathrel{R} 1}$, since ${1 \nless 1}$; ${2 \not\mathrel{R} 1}$, since ${2 \nless 1}$, and ${2 \not\mathrel{R} 2}$, since ${2 \nless 2}$.</p>

			<p><span class="topic">Cartesian Products and Relations.</span> Recall: Given two sets $A$ and $B$, the <span class="italicsText">Cartesian product</span> ${A \times B}$ is the set of all ordered pairs ${(x, y)}$ such that ${x \in A}$ and ${y \in B}$. Or, more formally:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						${A \times B = \{ (x,y) \mid x \in A \text{ and } y \in B \}}$.
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>So, suppose we had two simple sets:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${A = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}}$</p>
					<p>${B = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>The Cartesian product ${A \times B}$ is:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						$A \times B = \{ (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3),
						(2,1), (2,2), (2,3) \}$.
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>If we know what ordered pairs are members of ${A \times B}$, then we know which elements of $A$ are related to which elements of $B$ and vice versa. More formally, suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. A <span class="boldText">relation $R$</span> from $A$ to $B$ is a subset of ${A \times B}$. Or, in set notation, ${A \mathrel{R} B \subseteq A \times B}$. Given ${(x,y) \in A \times B}$, $x$ is related to $y$ by $\mathrel{R}$ (${x \mathrel{R} y}$) if, and only if, ${(x,y) \in \mathrel{R}}$. The set $A$ is called the <span class="boldText">domain</span> of $R$, and the set $B$ is called the <span class="boldText">codomain</span> of $R$.</p>
			<p>Given sets $x$ and $y$ related by a relation $R$, we denote the domain and codomain of a relation with the notation:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>
						${\mathrel{R} : x \mapsto y }$, where $x$ is the domain, and $y$
						is the codomain.
					</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>Thus, whenever we see the notation ${x \mathrel{R} y}$, we can infer that ${(x,y) \in \mathrel{R}}$. And whenever we see the notation ${x \not\mathrel{R} y}$, we can infer that ${(x,y) \notin \mathrel{R}}$.</p>

		<section id="functions_formula_defined" class="grid-item">
			<h4>Functions Defined by Formulas</h4>
			<p>We often define functions in mathematics with formulas. For example, the <span class="boldText">squaring function</span> $f$ from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ is defined by the formula ${f(x) = x^2}$ for every ${x \in \mathbb{R}.}$ Whatever real number is substituted for $x$, the output of $f$ will be the square of that number (${f: x \mapsto x^2.}$)</p>
			<p>Likewise, the <span class="boldText">successor function</span> $g$ from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}$ is defined by the formula ${g(n) = n + 1.}$ Thus, whatever integer is substituted for $n$, the output of $g$ is the number plus 1.</p>
			<p>While functions are often defined by formulas, we should remember that they are just relations, which are in turn just subsets of a Cartesian product. Thus, if $f$ and $g$ ad functions from a set $A$ to a set $B$, then:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>${f = \{ (x,y) \in A \times B \mid y = f(x) \}}$</li>
				<li>${g = \{ (x,y) \in A \times B \mid y = g(x) \}}$</li>

			<p>Given this fact, it follows that: ${f = g \iff f(x) = g(x) \text{ for all } x \in A.}$</p>

			<h3>Logic</h3>
			<p>Symbolic logic provides the foundations of both computer science and mathematics. The following materials provide a review of the logic necessary to understanding mathematics.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="logical_form_and_logical_equivalence" class="grid-item">
			<h4>Arguments</h4>
			<p>An <span class="boldText">argument</span> is a sequence of statements leading to an assertion. The assertion at the end of the sequence is called the <span class="boldText">conclusion</span>, and the preceding statements are called <span class="boldText">premises</span>.</p>
			<p>When we create or assess arguments, there are two things we should always distinguish:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The argument's <span class="italicsText">intrinsic merit</span>; and</li>
				<li>The argument's <span class="italicsText">form</span>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Logical analysis has no business, and provides no help, with an argument's intrinsic merits. Where it does help, however, is determining whether a conclusion <span class="italicsText">necessarily</span> follows from the <span class="italicsText">truth</span> of the premises.</p>
			<p>For example, consider the argument: "If taxes are raised, then unemployment increases. If unemployment increases, then government expenditures increase. Since government expenditures did not increase, taxes were not raised." Strictly from a logical analysis, there are no problems with this argument. But, there may be problems with the argument's intrinsic merits (is it not the case that government expenditures can go unchanged, or even decrease, while taxes are raised?). Logic does not help determine whether the argument's premises are true (Is it true that raising taxes increases unemployment? Is it true that increased unemployment leads to increased government expenditures?). Logic can help determine whether the premises are conclusions that necessarily follow from other premises, but without more, logical analysis provides no aid here.</p>

		<section id="logical_propositions" class="grid-item">
			<h4>Logical Statements</h4>
			<p>Arguments consist of <span class="boldText">propositions</span> &mdash; sentences that can be assigned the values <span class="italicsText">true</span> or <span class="italicsText">false</span>, but not both. The entirety of mathematics is composed of terms defined by using terms previously defined. This process of using terms to define terms, however, had to start somewhere. For this reason, there are a few terms in mathematics taken to be <span class="italicsText">undefined</span>. The terms <span class="italicsText">sentence</span>, <span class="italicsText">true</span>, and <span class="italicsText">false</span>, are examples of undefined terms in mathematics.</p>
			<p>Following the definition of a proposition, the following sentences are propositions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>${1 + 1 = 2}$ (true)</li>
				<li>${2^2 = 18}$ (false)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The sentence ${x^2 = 16}$ is not a proposition, because we cannot assign it the value true or false unless we provide some value for $x$. It is both true or false, depending on $x$.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="compound_propositions_logical_connectives" class="grid-item">
			<h4>Compound Propositions &amp; Logical Connectives</h4>
			<p>Propositions can be connected with <span class="italicsText">logical connectives</span> to create <span class="boldText">compound propositions</span>. For example, the propositions "$x$ is less than <span class="italicsText">or</span> to 4" and "$s$ is a member of $A$ but not a member of $B$" are examples of compound propositions.</p>
			<p>To form compound propositions, the connected propositions must have set truth values. In other words, we cannot connect propositions that do not already have the assigned values of <span class="italicsText">true</span> or <span class="italicsText">false</span>. Once we <span class="italicsText">know</span> what the truth values for individual propositions, we can then connect them with logical connectives.

			<h4>Logical Equivalence &amp; Propositional Forms</h4>
			<p>Given propositions $p$ and $q$, we can use logical connectives to construct the compound propositions ${\neg p}$, ${p \land q}$, and ${p \lor q.}$ Compound propositions themselves can be connected to form more complicated expressions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>${\neg p \lor q}$</li>
				<li>${(\neg p \lor q) \land \neg (p \lor q)}$</li>
				<li>${\neg ((p \land q) \lor (p \land (p \lor \neg q)))}$</li>

			<ol>
				<li>Expressions inside brackets/parentheses are performed first</li>
				<li>The <span class="monoText">NOT</span> operator is performed second.</li>
				<li>The operator <span class="monoText">AND</span> is performed third.</li>
				<li>The operator <span class="monoText">OR</span> is performed last.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><span class="topic">Logical Equivalence.</span> The statements "2 is greater than 1" and "1 is less than 2" are two different ways of saying the same thing. This is because of the definitions of the words &#8220;greater than&#8221; and &#8220;less than.&#8221; Both statements, together, can only be: (1) both true, or (2) both false. In other words, if the statements were connected with a logical connective and evaluated in a truth table, their truth values would be identical.</p>
			<p>For example, suppose $p$ and $q$ are propositions. The compound propositions ${p \land q}$ and ${q \land p}$ have the same truth values:</p>

I.e., "Apples are NOT red BUT sweet"; "Apples are red BUT NOT sweet"; "Apples are NOT red AND are NOT sweet." These propositions can be reduced to a single proposition: "Apples are NOT red OR are NOT sweet."</p>
			<p>Similarly, consider the proposition: "Apples are red OR green." Like the <span class="monoText">AND</span> proposition above, this is a compound proposition: (1) "Apples are red." (2) "Apples are green." Thus, for the compound proposition to be false, both (1) and (2) must be false, because an <span class="monoText">OR</span> proposition is false if, and only if, both of its component propositions are false.

			<p>Suppose a compound inequality of the form ${x \stackrel{?}= y \stackrel{?}= z}$ (the symbol ${\stackrel{?}=}$ means "unknown relation," and represents the possibility of any of the relation symbols $=$, $>$, $<$, $\leq$, $\geq$, etc.).

			<p>As an aside, the last example might spark some thought about how we assign truth values to propositions. Consider for example Immanuel Kant's observation of three values: the "alive," the "dead," and somewhere in the middle, the "undead." Is there any relationship between the fact that these terms exist and how we evaluate the truth values of propositions? If the answer is yes, does the relationship affect the proposition that such a relationship exists?</p>

			<p>Observe that the biconditional "$p$ iff $q$" is logically equivalent to "$p$ if $q$ and $q$ if $p$." In other words, the biconditional is logically equivalent to the conjunction of the conditional and its converse. Symbolically:</p>

				<div>

			<h3>Arguments</h3>
			<p>An <span class="boldText">argument</span> is a sequence of propositions leading to a conclusion. Needless to say, arguments are the building blocks of mathematics, so their careful study is indispensable to any budding mathematician. Arguments have strict terminology that we must always keep in mind when we evaluate them.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="logic_intro" class="grid-item">
			<p><span class="topic">Arguments: Form v. Substance.</span> <span class="boldText">Logic</span> is the study of systematically evaluating arguments for <span class="italicsText">internal cogency</span>. There are numerous standards for internal cogency, but the standard we are most often concerned with in mathematics is <span class="boldText">logical validity</span>. Consider the argument synonymous with introductory logic texts:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<ul class="larg">
						<li>All men are mortal.</li>
						<li>Socrates is a man.</li>
						<li class="conc">Socrates is mortal.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>From the argument, we can ask two questions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Are the <span class="boldText">premises</span> true?</li>
				<li>What is the <span class="italicsText">quality</span> of the <span class="boldText">inference steps</span> from the premises to the conclusion?</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These two questions evidence a distinction: Asking whether an argument starts from true premises is different from asking how the argument moves from one proposition to the next. True, we generally want our arguments to satisfy both conditions. Nevertheless, they are two separate questions requiring different knowledge. Whether premises are true is an issue of <span class="italicsText">substance</span> &mdash; the question is determined by reference to data or known facts. Thus, the issue is within the expert's domain. If the argument concerns economics, then whether the premises are true is answered by the economist. If physics, the physicist, and if mathematics, the mathematician. On the other hand, <span class="boldText">internal cogency</span> &mdash; an argument's movement, or flow, from one proposition to the next &mdash; is an issue of <span class="italicsText">form</span>. It concerns both the expert and the logician.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="deduction_vs_induction" class="grid-item">
			<p><span class="topic">Deduction v. Induction.</span> The argument in the preceding example is described as <span class="boldText">deductively valid</span>. Now consider this argument:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<ul class="larg">
						<li>My doctor has never poisoned anyone.</li>
						<li>The medicine I've been prescribed is a routine prescription.</li>
						<li class="conc">My doctor will not poison me.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>Notice the difference between this argument and the preceding one. It does not share the same &#8220;air-tight&#8221; quality. There is nothing &#8220;wrong&#8221; with the argument, but it's internal cogency is different. When we extrapolate from past data to arrive at conclusions about the future, we engage in <span class="boldText">inductive reasoning</span>. Inductive arguments can have <span class="italicsText">inductively strong</span> conclusions (it his highly probable that, assuming the premises are true, the conclusion is true) or <span class="italicsText">inductively weak</span> conclusions (it is unlikely that, assuming the premises are true, the conclusion is true). Inductive reasoning is the kind of reasoning we use daily. Time management, decisions concerning our relationships with others, whether to buy something now or later, these all involve inductions. Inductive reasoning is a difficult and complex area of logic, and we can only study it meaningfully if we have a good grasp of deductive reasoning. Accordingly, we will relegate our discussion to deductive reasoning for now.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="argument_form" class="grid-item">
			<h4>Argument Form</h4>
			<p>All arguments have an <span class="boldText">argument form</span> &mdash; the sequence of <span class="italicsText">propositional forms</span>. All propositions in an argument and all propositional forms in an argument form, except for the very last, are called <span class="boldText">premises</span>. Every premise relies on either one or more <span class="boldText">assumptions</span>, propositions treated as true without further proof, and are themselves premises in an argument. Premises may be <span class="boldText">explicit</span> &mdash; stated clearly to the audience, or <span class="boldText">implicit</span> &mdash; unstated. All premises lead to a final proposition or propositional form called the <span class="boldText">conclusion</span>.</p>
			<p>Implicit premises are often the best place to find weaknesses and problems in arguments. However, before we even assess an argument's premises, we must consider the argument's <span class="boldText">validity</span>. Whether an argument is <span class="italicsText">valid</span> depends on <span class="italicsText">argument form</span>. An argument is valid if, and only if, no matter what propositions are substituted for the proposition variables in the argument's premises, if the argument's premises are <span class="italicsText">all true</span>, then the conclusion <span class="italicsText">is also true</span>. If an argument satisfies this requirement, then the argument is <span class="boldText">valid</span>; otherwise, the argument is <span class="boldText">invalid</span>.</p>
			<p>The core requirement for validity is: If the argument's premises are all true, then the argument's conclusion must follow by logical form alone. Notice what this means. It is logically impossible for a valid argument to have all true premises and a false conclusion. When an argument is valid and its premises are true, we say that the conclusion's truth is <span class="boldText">inferred</span> or <span class="boldText">deduced</span> from the truth of the premises. If a conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises being true (i.e., the premises are all true but the conclusion is false or the conclusion could be true <span class="italicsText">or</span> false), then the conclusion is not validly deduced.</p>
			<p>We can test for an argument's validity procedurally:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Identify all of the argument's assumptions.</li>
				<li>Identify all of the argument's premises.</li>
				<li>Identify the argument's conclusion.</li>
				<li>Identify all logical connectives linking each proposition (this constructs the argument's form).</li>
				<li>Construct a truth table:</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Enumerate the truth values for the assumptions.</li>
					<li>Enumerate the truth values for the premises.</li>
					<li>Enumerate the truth values for the conclusion.</li>
					<li>Evaluate the truth values for the logical connectives between the propositions in (a) through (c).</li>
				</ol>
				<li>If a row in the truth table shows all of the premises are true, that row is called the <span class="boldText">critical row</span>.</li>
				<li>If there is a critical row where the conclusion is false, then it is <span class="italicsText">possible</span> for an argument of the given form to have true premises and a false conclusion, so the argument form is <span class="boldText">invalid</span>.</li>
				<li>Else, if the conclusion of <span class="underlineText">every critical row</span> is true, then the argument form is <span class="boldText">valid</span>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For example, consider the following argument:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<ul class="larg">
						<li>${p \implies (q \lor (\neg r))}$</li>
						<li>${q \implies (p \land r)}$</li>
						<li class="conc">${p \implies r}$</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>We can assess this argument's validity following the procedures above to construct a truth table:</p>
			<figure class="table">
				<table class="truth_table">

			<p>Notice that we did not fill in some of the cells in the truth table. This is because when we use a truth table to assess validity, we are only concerned with the rows where all of the premises are true. We do not need to consider situations where the premises are false. In the truth table above, there is a critical row where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Thus, the argument above is <span class="italicsText">invalid</span>.</p>

		<section id="generalization" class="grid-item">

		<section id="contradiction" class="grid-item">
			<h4>Contradiction</h4>
			<p>The principle of <span class="boldText">contradiction</span> is a cornerstone of mathematics. It is at the very heart of the method of <span class="italicsText">proof by contradiction</span>. Suppose $p$ is a proposition we wish to deduce. We can prove that $p$ is true with the following argument form:</p>
			<div class="mproof">
				<div class="premises">
					<ul>
						<li>Suppose that $p$ is false.</li>
						<li>assumption</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>If $p$ is false, then there is a logical contradiction.</li>
						<li>the data</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>$p$ is false.</li>
						<li>the assumption</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>&#8756; $p$ must be true.</li>
						<li>the contradiction rule</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="conclusion">
					<ul>
						<li>$p$ is true</li>
						<li>Q.E.D.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<p>The critical step in this argument is the second premise: That there is a logical contradiction if $p$ is false. For this premise to be true, $p$ being false must contradict the <span class="boldText">data</span> &mdash; what we know as facts. This rule of inference is called the <span class="boldText">contradiction rule</span>. Symbolically:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<ul class="larg">
						<li>${\neg p \implies \bot}$</li>
						<li>${\neg p}$</li>
						<li class="conc">${p}$</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>The contradiction rule can be proved with a truth table:</p>
			<figure class="table">
				<table class="truth_table">
					<thead>
						<th>${p}$</th>
						<th>${\neg p}$</th>
						<th>${\bot}$</th>
						<th>${\neg p \implies \bot}$</th>

			<p><span class="boldText">Eliminating possible cases.</span> The contradiction rule also allows us to narrow down possible cases by way of a powerful rule: If an assumption leads to a contradiction, then that assumption <span class="underlineText">must be false</span>.</p>
			<p>As an example of how useful this rule is, consider the following problem presented by the logician Raymond Smullyan:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>There exists an island with two types of inhabitants:</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Knights who always tell the truth; and</li>
					<li>Knaves who always lie.</li>
				</ol>
				<li>On visiting the island, you are approached by two natives, $A$ and $B$, who state:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>$A$: $B$ is a knight.</li>
					<li>$B$: $A$ and I are of opposite type.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>What are $A$ and $B$?</p>
			<details class="answer">
				<summary>Answer</summary>
				<p>First, we observe that there are four possibilites:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>$A$ is a knight and $B$ is a knight.</li>
					<li>$A$ is a knight and $B$ is a knave.</li>
					<li>$A$ is a knave and $B$ is a knight.</li>
					<li>$A$ is a knave and $B$ is a knave.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Next, suppose that $A$ is a knight. If $A$ is a knight, then $A$ always tells the truth. Thus, $B$ is a knight. But, if $B$ is a knight, then $B$ always tells the truth, so $A$ is a knave. This is a contradiction. Thus, $A$ cannot be a knight. $A$ must be a knave.</p>
				<p>If $A$ is a knave, then $A$ always tells lies. Thus, $B$ is not a knight. $B$ is therefore a knave. And since $B$ is a knave, $B$ always tells lies, so $A$ and $B$ are not of opposite type. Accordingly, both $A$ and $B$ are knaves.</p>

			<p>We cannot determine this argument's validity with the previous tools we used, ${\neg,}$ ${\land,}$ ${\lor,}$ ${\implies,}$ and ${\iff.}$ Those tools are exclusive to <span class="boldText">propositional calculus</span> &mdash; the symbolic analysis of <span class="italicsText">ordinary compound statements</span>.</p>
			<p>In contrast, the argument above requires <span class="boldText">predicate calculus</span> &mdash; the symbolic analysis of <span class="italicsText">predicates</span> and <span class="italicsText">quantified statements</span>. Predicate calculus requires us to take a closer look at words like &#8220;all,&#8221; &#8220;some,&#8221; and &#8220;is,&#8221; to name a few.</p>
			<p><span class="topic">What is a predicate?</span> In everyday grammar, a <span class="italicsText">predicate</span> is the part of the sentence that gives information about the subject. For example, the sentence, &#8220;Bertrand Russell is a British philosopher.&#8221; The subject is &#8220;Bertrand Russell&#8221; and the predicate is &#8220;is a British philosopher.&#8221;</p>
			<p>In logic, we obtain predicates by isolating various parts of the sentence. From the previous example, we can isolate the sentence into several variables:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>Let ${P \coloneqq \text{"is a British philosopher"}}$</p>
					<p>Let ${Q \coloneqq \text{"is a British"}}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>The symbols $P$ and $Q$ are called <span class="boldText">predicate symbols</span>, and we can use them to generalize the example sentence. For example, the sentence &#8220;$x$ is a British philosopher&#8221; can be symbolized as ${P(x).}$ Likewise, the sentence &#8220;$x$ is a British $y$&#8221; can be symbolized as ${Q(x, y).}$ The variables $x$ and $y$ are called <span class="boldText">predicate variables</span>, which take values from specified sets. When concrete values are substituted into those variables, we obtain a <span class="boldText">sentence</span>. Otherwise, these generalized sentences, ${P(x)}$ and ${Q(x, y),}$ are called by various names: <span class="boldText">propositional functions</span>, <span class="boldText">open sentences</span>, or <span class="boldText">open formulas</span>.</p>
			<div class="rule">

			<p>In the exercises above, we proved particular propositions false by checking each possible case, or, more specifically, each element in the proposition's domain.

The method will work whenever a proposition's domain is finite (of course, assuming we do not exhaust ourselves before we exhaust the possibilities).</p>
			<p>Most propositions in mathematics, however, will have domains with infinite individuals, or, if not infinite, a large enough size to render the method of exhaustion impractical. For this reason, the method of exhaustion rarely work for producing general mathematical propositions. Nevertheless, it is a method we should always consider when confronting logical predicates.</p>

			<p>This is an example of a statement containing multiple quantifiers. Moreover, it is an <span class="italicsText">ambiguous</span> statement because there are two possible interpretations: (1) There is a single teaching assistant supervising all of the student sections; or (2) For each student section, there is exactly one teaching assistant supervising. In everyday speech, we rely on context to resolve this ambiguity. If there are 20 student sections occurring at different times, some simultaneously, then (2) is likely the correct interpretation.</p>

			<p>In mathematics, we <span class="underlineText">cannot</span> rely on context, and ambiguity must be quickly rooted out or prevented at all costs. This is done by ensuring our statements conform to established rules. The core rule:</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div class="rule">
					<p><span class="topic">Rule.</span> When a statement contains multiple quantifiers, we assume the actions suggested by the quantifiers are performed in the order in which they occur.</p>

			<p>The statement above is read: For all ${x}$ in ${D,}$ there exists a ${y}$ in ${E}$ such that the property ${P}$ holds for ${x}$ and ${y.}$ For the proposition to be true, the following must be true:</p>

				<li>She would find that there is an element ${y}$ inside ${E}$ such that both ${x}$ and ${y}$ satisfy property ${P.}$</li>

			<p>Now consider the following statement:</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${\exists x \in D : [\forall y \in E : P(x, y)]}$</p>

			<p>We read the statement above as: There exists an ${x}$ in ${D}$ such that, for all ${y}$ in ${E,}$ the property ${P}$ holds for both ${x}$ and ${y.}$</p>

			<h4>Arguments with Quantified Statements</h4>
			<p>Below are some of the most common argument forms and rules related to quantified statements.</p>

			<p><span class="topic">Universal Instantiation.</span> If a property is true for everything in a set, then it is true for a particular member of that set. A famous example:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<ul class="larg">
						<li>All men are mortal.</li>
						<li>Socrates is a man.</li>
						<li class="conc">Socrates is mortal.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>Universal instantiation is the foundational principle of deductive logic. Because ${x}$ is an instance of a particular type ${m,}$ and we know that all instances of type ${m}$ inherit property ${N,}$ it must be true that ${x}$ has the property ${N.}$</p>

			<p><span class="topic">Universal Modus Ponens.</span> Consider the following argument:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<ul class="larg">
						<li>For all mangoes, if the mango is yellow, then the mango is ripe.</li>
						<li>This fruit is a yellow mango.</li>
						<li class="conc">This fruit is a ripe mango.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>This is an example of <span class="italicsText">universal modus ponens</span>. More formally:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div class="rule">
					<p><span class="topic">Definition.</span> The argument form <span class="italicsText">universal modus ponens</span> takes the form:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<ul class="larg">
								<li>${\forall x \in D : [P(x) \implies Q(x)]}$</li>
								<li>${a \in D : P(a)}$</li>
								<li class="conc">${Q(a)}$</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</figure>
				</div>
			</figure>

			<p><span class="topic">Universal Modus Tollens.</span> Now consider this argument:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<ul class="larg">
						<li>All humans are mortal.</li>
						<li>Zeus is not mortal.</li>
						<li class="conc">Zeus is not human.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>We call this argument form <span class="italicsText">universal modus tollens</span>. The argument provides: All instances of ${x}$ have some property ${P.}$ Since ${z}$ does not have the property ${P,}$ ${z}$ is not an instance of ${x.}$</p>

			<h4>Translating Informal Language to Formal Logic</h4>
			<p>To properly analyze statements, we must be able to quickly translate informal language to formal logic and vice versa. Below are translation methods, both for propositional and predicate calculus.</p>
			<p><span class="topic">Exclusive Disjunction</span>. The word <span class="italicsText">or</span>, by default, is inclusive. Thus, given two propositions $p$ and $q$, When we refer to the <span class="italicsText">exclusive or</span>, we mean ${(p \lor q) \land (\neg (p \land q)),}$ or ${p \oplus q}$ for short.</p>
			<p>Note that when we say ${p \oplus q,}$ we are saying that $p$ and $q$ have different truth-values. Because they have different truth values, we are denying the biconditional ${p \iff q.}$ Thus, ${(p \oplus q) \implies (\neg (p \iff q.))}$</p>
			<p>For example, the sentence &#8220;Either John is lying or Jane is lying&#8221; implies that it cannot be true that John or Jane is lying if and only if the other is lying.</p>
			<p><span class="topic">Conjunctions</span>. The following words all indicate a conjunction:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>&#8220;and&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;including&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;but&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;moreover&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;furthermore&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;however&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;although&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;even though&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;additionally&#8221;</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Conjunctions often connect nouns or adjectives rather than propositions. When confronted with such conjunctions, there are individual propositions.</p>
			<div class="compare">
				<div>
					<p>&#8220;John and Jane are siblings.&#8221;</p>
					<ul>
						<li>&#8220;John is a sibling.&#8221;</li>
						<li>&#8220;Jane is a sibling.&#8221;</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>&#8220;The kiwi is ripe, green, and sweet.&#8221;</p>
					<ul>
						<li>&#8220;The kiwi is ripe.&#8221;</li>
						<li>&#8220;The kiwi is green.&#8221;</li>
						<li>&#8220;The kiwi is sweet.&#8221;</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Notice that the John and Jane example sentence does not imply that John and Jane are siblings to one another.</p>
			<p><span class="topic">Words Indicating Existential Quantifiers</span> There are numerous indicators of existential quantifiers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>&#8220;there exists&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;there is a&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;there are&#8221; (this implies there is at least one)</li>
				<li>&#8220;we can find a&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;there is at least one&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;for some&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;for at least one&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;for most&#8221; (this also implies there is at least one)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><span class="topic">&#8220;neither ... nor ...&#8221;</span> Given two propositions $p$ and ${q,}$ the proposition &#8220;Neither $p$ nor $q$&#8221; means that both $p$ and $q$ are false:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${\text{neither $p$ nor $q$} \equiv (\neg p) \land (\neg q)}$</p>
					<p>${\phantom{\text{Neither $p$ nor $q$}} \equiv \neg (p \lor q)}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p><span class="topic">&#8220;not both, both not&#8221;</span> Given the proposition ${\text{not both $p$ and $q$},}$ we mean that $p$ and $q$ cannot both be true. One of them may be true, but not both. In contrast, when we say ${\text{both not $p$ and $q$},}$ we are denying each of $p$ and $q$. Thus:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${\text{not both $p$ and $q$} \equiv \neg (p \land q)}$</p>
					<p>${\phantom{\text{not both $p$ and $q$}} \equiv (\neg p) \lor (\neg q)}$</p>
					<p>${\text{both not $p$ and $q$} \equiv (\neg p) \land (\neg q)}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p><span class="topic">&#8220;unless&#8221;</span> The word <span class="italicsText">unless</span> denotes an inclusive disjunction, and in some instances, an exclusive disjunction. A helpful way to translate such statements is the following: Suppose $a$ and $b$ are propositions. Then:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${\text{$a$ unless $b$} \equiv b \implies (\neg a)}$</p>
					<p>${\phantom{\text{$a$ unless $b$}} \equiv a \implies (\neg b)}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p><span class="topic">Words Indicating Universal Quantifiers</span> Likewise, for universal quantifiers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>&#8220;every&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;each&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;all&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;any&#8221;</li>

			<h3>Digital Logic Circuits</h3>
			<p>Digital circuits are an ideal medium for applying concepts in logic. In 1937, MIT graduate student Claude Shannon constructed a method for solving circuitry problems by analogizing switches to logical connectives. Shannon's idea was a milestone in human achievement &mdash; it laid the foundations for modern circuits, the very bedrock of modern digital devices. In the next sections, we apply the principles of logic through circuit analysis.</p>

		<section id="digital_logic_circuits_symbols" class="grid-item">
			<h4>Circuit Symbols</h4>
			<p>Before proceeding to actual analysis, we should be familiar with its language. Below are common symbols in circuit design alongside their descriptions.</p>

			<h4>Logic Gates</h4>
			<p>Consider the following circuits:</p>
			<figure><img src="images/series_v_parallel.svg" alt="series v parallel" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy"></figure>
			<p>In <span class="italicsText">circuit A</span>, the diode turns on if, and only if, both switches $p$ and $q$ are closed. In <span class="italicsText">circuit B</span>, the diode turns on if, and only if, at least one of the switches $p$ and $q$ are closed. <span class="italicsText">Circuit A</span> is said to be <span class="boldText">in series</span>, and <span class="italicsText">Circuit B</span> is said to be <span class="boldText">in parallel</span>.</p>

			<p>As we can probably tell, writing out truth tables with such formalism can easily become difficult to read. Indeed, as technology progressed, circuits grew more complicated, developing a need for a more robust and comprehensive language to design and analyze circuits. <span class="boldText">Digital logic circuits</span> were invented to address that need by abstracting lower-level technical details. Part of that abstraction is doing away with words like &#8220;true&#8221; and &#8220;false&#8221; or &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off.&#8221; In lieu, the symbols <span class="monoText">0</span> and <span class="monoText">1</span> became, and continue to be, the governing symbols for representing binary values (<span class="monoText">0</span> for off/false; <span class="monoText">1</span> for on/true). The statistician John Tukey called these symbols &mdash; <span class="monoText">0</span> and <span class="monoText">1</span> &mdash; <span class="boldText">bits</span> (<span class="underlineText">b</span>inary dig<span class="underlineText">its</span>), and they have remained so named since. It is these logic gates that we will use in applying the principals of logic.</p>

			<h4>Black Box Abstraction &amp; Logic Gates</h4>
			<p>The foundational principle to digital logic circuits, and a core programming principle in computer science, is the <span class="boldText">black box</span> &mdash; encapsulating circuits into a single "box" that can be used as a component for other, more complicated circuits. The most basic black boxes are <span class="boldText">logic gates</span>. These black boxes are analogous to logical connectives. We examine them each in turn.</p>

		<section id="counting" class="grid-item">
			<h3>Counting</h3>
			<p>In these next few sections, we explore the basics of <span class="italicsText">counting</span>. The concept of counting might seem intuitive, but looks can be deceiving. Many counting problems require us to first determine (a) <span class="italicsText">what</span> exactly it is we are counting, and (b) <span class="italicsText">how</span> we should count. It is these problems that concern the next sections.</p>
			<p>Before we begin counting, however, we must revisit some aspects of basic set theory. Like many other areas of mathematics, counting depends heavily on set theoretic foundations.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="set_theory_counting" class="grid-item">
			<h4>Basic Set Theory</h4>
			<p>A <span class="term">set</span> is simply a collection of <span class="italicsText">distinct</span> objects. For example, ${\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \}}$ is a set. Contrary to what may be taught in high school courses, ${\{ 1, 1, 1, 2 \}}$ is a <span class="term">bag</span>, not a set. A bag, also called a <span class="italicsText">multiset</span> or <span class="italicsText">mset</span>, is a collection of distinct and non-distinct objects; i.e., there may be more than one instance of each of its elements. We are concerned here primarily with sets. </p>

			<p>Clearly, there are 10 numbers. This is a very basic counting problem, and it is what we think of when hear the word &#8220;counting&#8221;. Now, how many numbers are between 8 and 16 inclusive (i.e., including 8 and 16)?:</p>

			<p>We could manually count each element. But, that approach is inefficient, particularly for very long sequences. A better way would be to simplify sequence into the one we saw previously:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${[

			<p>From this approach, we can see that given two positive numbers ${a}$ and ${b}$ where ${b > a,}$ the number of integers in the sequence ${[a, a+1, \ldots, b-1, b]}$ is: ${(b - a) + 1.}$</p>

			<p>We can use the proposition above for even more complex problems. For example, how many multiples of 3 are between 62 and 215?</p>
			<p>Well, we know the first multiple of three between 62 and 215 is 63. The last multiple of three is 213. Thus, the actual array we want to count is ${63, 66, 69, \ldots, 213.}$ Now, we need to convert this array into one we know how to count, so we divide each element in the array by 3: ${21, 22, 23, \ldots , 71.}$ From our previous proposition, we know how to count this array: ${(71 - 21) + 1 = 51.}$ Thus, there are 51 numbers in the array &mdash; i.e., there are 51 multiples of 3 between 62 and 215.</p>
			<p>Let's try another one. How many multiples of 10 are between 9 and 101? Again, the first multiple of 10 is 10. The last multiple of 10 is 100. Thus, the sequence is ${[10, 20, \ldots, 100].}$ We divide by 10: ${[1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10].}$ And again, we know how to count this sequence: ${(10 - 1) + 1 = 10.}$ There are 10 multiples of 10 between 9 and 101.</p>
			<p>How many multiples of 10 are between 11 and 103? Here, the first multiple of 10 is 20. The last multiple of 10 is 100. We have the sequence ${[20, 30, \ldots, 100].}$ Dividing by 3: ${[2, 3, 4, \ldots, 10.]}$ Then counting: ${(10-2) + 1 = 9.}$ There are 9 multiples of 10 between 11 and 103.</p>
			<p>Now that we know how to count multiples, we can start counting even more elaborate sequences: How many four-digit positive integers are perfect cubes?</p>
			<p>Solution: We know that the first four-digit positive integer that is a perfect cube is ${10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 = 1000.}$ The last four-digit perfect cube is a bit trickier to find. Fortunately, the method of exhaustion is feasible here. We know ${20 \cdot 20 \cdot 20 = 8000.}$ This is already pretty close to five-digits, so let's just try the next positive integer: ${21 \cdot 21 \cdot 21 = 9,261.}$ Now we're very close; 22 will probably enter five-digit territory: ${22 \cdot 22 \cdot 22 = 10,648.}$ Great, so we know our sequence is ${[1000, \ldots, 9261].}$ Taking the cubic root of each element, we have ${[10, \ldots, 21.]}$ Counting this list: ${(21 - 10) + 1 = 12.}$ Hence, there are 12 four-digit positive integers that are perfect cubes.</p>
			<p><span class="exh">Exercise.</span> How many numbers are in the following sequences:</p>

					<p>Again, we convert the sequence into one we can actually count. We can see each element is a multiple of 2.

					<p>Again, we convert the sequence into one we can count. We can see that each element in the sequence differs by 5. To simplify the sequence so we can divide by 5, let's add 3 to each element: ${[-30, -25, -20, \ldots, 55, 60.]}$ Now let's divide by 5: ${-6, -5, -4, \ldots, 11, 12.}$ Using our formula: ${(12 - (-6)) + 1 = 19.}$ Thus, ${n(S) = 19.}$</p>

					<summary>Solution</summary>
					<p>We can see each element differs by ${\frac{2}{3}.}$ Let's try and give all of the elements a common denominator: ${[\frac{11}{3}, \frac{13}{3}, \frac{15}{3}, \ldots, \frac{79}{3}, \frac{81}{3}].}$ Since each of the elements has a multiplier of ${\frac{1}{3},}$ we can factor ${\frac{1}{3}}$ out, leaving us with: ${[11, 13, 15, \ldots, 79, 81.]}$ These are all separated by 2, so let's subtract 1 to each element: ${[10, 12, 14, \ldots, 78, 80];}$ then divide by 2: ${[5, 6, 7, \ldots, 39, 40.]}$ We can count this list: ${(40-5) + 1 = 36.}$ Thus, ${n(C) = 36.}$</p>

				<summary>Solution</summary>
				<p>Again, let's come up with a sequence. First, let's find the first element. The first element is 9: ${3^2 = 9.}$ Now let's find the last element. We know ${12^2 = 144.}$ So just a little higher. ${13^2 = 169.}$ ${15 \times 15 = 225;}$ too high. ${14^2 = 196,}$ but this is even. So, the first element is 9, and the last element is 169. Thus, we have ${[9, 25, 49, 81, \ldots 196].}$ Taking the square root each element: ${[3, 5, 7, 9, \ldots , 13.]}$ Subtracting 1 from each element: ${[2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots , 12.]}$ Dividing each element by 2: ${[1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots, 6.]}$ Thus, there are 6 odd perfect squares between 5 and 211.</p>

			<p><span class="exh">Exercise.</span> How many sets of four consecutive positive integers are there such that the product of the four integers is less than 100,000?</p>
			<details class="answer">
				<summary>Solution</summary>
				<p>First, the smallest element in this sequence is ${[1, 2, 3, 4] = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 24}$ (remember, we're looking for consecutive positive integers). Now, we have to look for the largest set. Let's focus on the value 100,000.</p>
				<p>We're looking for four numbers that when multiplied together produce 100,000. Let's look at a simpler case, a number to the power of 4. We know that ${20^4 = 160,000.}$ Let's try another number: ${19^4 = 130,321.}$ Getting a little closer. ${18^4 = 104,976.}$ This is pretty close, so the last number has to be immediately next to 18. Let's try another one: ${17^4 = 83,521.}$ This is lower than 100,000. This means the set of four integers is somewhere in the vicinity of 17 and 18. Let's try: ${15 \cdot 16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 = 73,440.}$ Close, but let's just try one more: ${16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 \cdot 19 = 93,024;}$ include 20 in the next set and we are definitely over 100,000. Thus, this is definitely the last element. Great, this means we have the following:</p>
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>${M = [\{1, 2, 3, 4\}, \ldots, \{16, 17, 18, 19\}]}$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
				<p>Now, the question is how do we count these? Well, let's think about how each of these sets work:</p>
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>${ \{ 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \} }$</p>
						<p>${ \{ 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \} }$</p>
						<p>${ \{ 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \} }$</p>
						<p>${ \{ 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \} }$</p>
						<p>${\vdots}$</p>
						<p>${ \{ 15 \cdot 16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 \} }$</p>
						<p>${ \{ 16 \cdot 17 \cdot 18 \cdot 19 \} }$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
				<p>If we focus on just the first number for each of the sets above, we get: ${1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots, 15, 16.}$ Thus, there are 16 different possible sets.</p>

			<h4>Counting with Addition and Subtraction</h4>
			<p>Counting is deeply intertwined with arithmetic. Consider the following problem:</p>
			<div class="rule">
				<p>12 students are taking at least 1 foreign language. The school offers only Spanish and French. 8 students take Spanish, 5 take both Spanish and French. How many students take French?</p>
			</div>
			<p>There are multiple ways to approach this problem, but the worst possible way is to blindly add and subtract. We want to think as logically as possible. More importantly, we want to think about this problem in terms of set theory. Here, we have a situation where students take Spanish, French, or both Spanish and French. The problem can be viewed as sets intersecting, where ${F = \text{French},}$ ${S = \text{Spanish}:}$</p>
			<figure><img src="images/french_and_spanish.svg" alt="int" loading="lazy" class="sixty-p"></figure>
			<p>The Venn diagram above can be thought of as representing several sections:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${F \cup S}$ = {all students}</p>
					<p>${F}$ = {all French students}</p>
					<p>${S}$ = {all Spanish students}</p>
					<p>${F \cap S}$ = {students taking French and Spanish}</p>
					<p>${F \setminus  S}$ = {students taking only French}</p>
					<p>${S \setminus  F}$ = {students taking only Spanish}</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>Here, we are asked to find ${n(F).}$ We have the following data:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${n(F \cup S) = 12}$</p>
					<p>${n(S) = 8}$</p>
					<p>${n(F \cap S) = 5}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>What else can we infer from this data? Well, we know that ${n(F \cap S) = 5.}$ These are the students that take both Spanish and French. Next, we know ${n(S) = 8;}$ there are 8 total students taking Spanish. Thus, we can make the following inference:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${n(S \setminus F) = n(S) - n(F \cap S) = 8 - 5 = 3.}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>Thus, there are 3 students that take only Spanish. How many students take only French? Well, it must be 4, since ${n(F \cup S) - n(S) = 12 - 8 = 4.}$ Hence, ${n(F) = n(F \setminus S) + n(F \cap S) = 4 + 5 = 9.}$</p>
			<p>Here is another problem:</p>
			<div class="rule">
				<p>Agnes has 27 cats. 14 cats are short-haired. 11 cats are kittens. 5 cats are long-haired adult cats (not kittens). How many short-haired kittens?</p>
			</div>
			<p>Again, set theory allows us to think about this as logically as possible. Here, we have several sets from the data above:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${S}$ = short-hairs</p>
					<p>${L}$ = long-hairs</p>
					<p>${K}$ = kittens</p>
					<p>${A}$ = adults</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>The problem gives us the following data, and the last line is what we want to find:</p>
			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${n(S \cup L) = n(A \cup K)}$ = total cats = 27</p>
					<p>${n(S) = n(K \cup S) + n(A \cup S)}$</p>
					<p>${n(L) = n(K \cup L) + n(A \cup L)}$</p>
					<p>${n(S) = 14}$</p>
					<p>${n(K) = 11}$</p>
					<p>${n(L \cap A) = 5}$</p>
					<p>${n(K \cap S) = ?}$</p>
				</div>
			</figure>
			<p>First, we know that ${n(K \cup A) = 27.}$ We also know that ${n(K) = 11.}$ Thus, ${n(A) = n(K \cup A) - n(K) = 27 - 11 = 16.}$ There are 16 adults.</p>
			<p>We know that ${n(L \cap A) = 5,}$ so ${n(A \cap S) = n(A) - n(A \cap L) = 16 - 5 = 11.}$ There are 11 short-hair adults. Now, we know ${n(S) = 14,}$ and we know that ${n(S) = n(K \cap S) + n(A \cap S).}$ Hence, ${n(K \cap S) = n(S) - n(A \cap S) = 14 - 11 = 3.}$ Therefore, there are 3 short-hair kittens.</p>

		<section id="proofs_introduction" class="grid-item">
			<h3>Mathematical Discovery</h3>
			<p>With the tools of logic we've learned thus far, we must now study how to use them. When we first encounter formal mathematics, we see numerous proofs. If we are so inclined, we might (and should) read them. Assuming the proof is well-written, seeing how its arguments flow from premise to conclusion often leaves a feeling of awe. &#8220;How on earth did they come up with this?&#8221;</p>
			<p>Proofs are as much an art as they are products of logical reasoning. Like Nerida's poems or Miyazaki's films, proofs do not result from some well-established formula. They are the products of guessing here and there, experimenting, stretching and shrinking ideas to their limits, supposing the outlandish, considering all possible cases, questioning the apparent &mdash; <span class="italicsText">creative</span>, not <span class="italicsText">mechanical</span>, endeavors.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, the fact that there is no well-established formula does not mean that there aren't common techniques. There is no formula to producing essays like David Foster Wallace's or E.B. White's, but there are common starting points and shared methods. The next sections survey different ways of discovering mathematics, and more broadly, solving problems logically.</p>
			<p>As we study the various techniques, we might ask, how do we obtain the levels of mathematical creativity like those seen in proofs and other solutions? The answer is no different from any field involving creativity &mdash; by gaining experience. Just as one becomes a better essayist by reading and writing essays, one can become better at solving mathematical problems by reading and constructing proofs, <span class="italicsText">and</span> completing those pesky problem sets.</p>
			<p>Whenever we encounter proofs in mathematical texts, they should be studied carefully and deeply. Note the patterns and strategies the author used. Note what could have been better. Whenever we answer a problem in a problem set, we should check our answers and compare our approach with others. Note the differences. If the other solution is better, note why.</p>
			<p>If we cannot determine the answer for ourselves and there is a provided solution, that solution must be studied with utmost precision. Why and how does that solution result? What is it that prevented us from finding the solution? What are the terms we do not understand?</p>
			<p>If we find that our answer is wrong, we've found a treasure chest of experience. Wrong answers and errors are far more valuable then correct answers. They indicate gaps in understanding or carelessness, and we must note them so they never repeat. All of these notes will prove valuable when we construct our own proofs or solve future problems.</p>

		<section id="understand_the_problem" class="grid-item">
			<h4>Understanding the Problem</h4>
			<p>The first step to approaching a problem is to <span class="italicsText">understand</span> the problem's statement. The goal is to ensure the problem is so clear and impressed in our minds that we can explain it to someone completely unfamiliar.</p>
			
			<p>To truly understand the problem, we must isolate the problem into its component parts. These component parts depend on what type of mathematical problem we're confronting. Generally, there are two types:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Problems of proving</li>
				<li>Problems of finding</li>
			</ol>
			<p><span class="topic">Problems of proving</span>. These are problems where we must construct an argument. For these problems, there are two parts we must isolate:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>the hypothesis; and</li>
				<li>the conclusion.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><span class="topic">Problems of finding.</span> These are problems where we must find a particular fact. The problem might ask us to solve for ${x;}$ to compute a derivative; to determine which set is a subset of which. For problems of finding, there are three parts we must isolate:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>the unknown;</li>
				<li>the data (what we know); and</li>
				<li>the conditions.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For both problems of proving and problems of finding, we isolate the parts by asking:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What do I know from the problem's statement?</li>
				<li>What do I know from outside the problem's statement?</li>
				<li>What do I <span class="underlineText">not</span> know from the problem's statement?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Answering the questions above is absolutely critical. Fortunately, there is a way to ensure we are thorough when we answer them. Recall that mathematical statements are propositions. Because they are propositions, we have a multitude of questions we can ask:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Is the statement an <span class="monoText">AND</span> proposition?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If it is an <span class="monoText">AND</span> proposition, then there are component propositions. Consider those propositions separately.</li>
					<li>For the statement to be true, all the component propositions must be true.</li>
					<li>For the statement to be false, we just need one of the component propositions to be false.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Is the statement an <span class="monoText">OR</span> proposition?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If it is an <span class="monoText">OR</span> proposition, then are there are component propositions. Consider those propositions separately.</li>
					<li>For the statement to be true, we just need one of the component propositions to be true.</li>
					<li>For the statement to be false, we need all of the component propositions to be false.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Is the statement a conditional proposition?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If it is, is it even possible to satisfy the conditions?</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Does satisfying the condition lead to a contradiction either in the problem or elsewhere?</li>
					</ul>
					<li>The only time a conditional proposition is false is if the sufficient condition is true and the necessary condition is false.</li>
					<li>If it is a conditional, what is the statement's contrapositive?</li>
					<ul>
						<li>If the contrapositive is true, then the statement is true.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Is the inverse true?</li>
					<li>Is the converse true?</li>
					<ul>
						<li>If the converse is true and the conditional is true, then the statement is a biconditional.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<li>What is the statement's negation?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If the statement's negation is true, then the statement is false.</li>
					<li>If the statement's negation is false, then the statement is true.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Is this statement a biconditional?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If the statement is a biconditional, then the statement has two component propositions.</li>
					<li>For the statement to be true, the component propositions must have the same truth values. Either both are false or both are true.</li>
					<li>For the statement to be false, one of the component propositions must be true while the other is false.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>All of the questions above will take considerable thought and careful working. We do not <span class="italicsText">need</span> to answer all of them, but working through them almost always results in a much clearer understanding of the problem. The only thing we need to do is to work very carefully.</p>
			<p>For both problems of proving and problems of finding, each part must be considered thoroughly. To do so, we ask the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What does this part mean?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>We shouldn't limit ourselves to a particular area of knowledge. Look to other areas of knowledge we have &mdash; set theory, geometry, algebra, physics, chemistry, even personal experience.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>What does this part imply?</li>
				<li>What does this part assume?</li>
				<li>How does this part relate to facts I know to be true?</li>
				<li>How does this part relate to this other part?</li>
				<li>How does this part relate to the entire problem?</li>

			<p>There are no wrong answers at this stage. We must let the mind wander and probe every thought we come across. Needless to say, this can be a chaotic process &mdash; we must write our thoughts down.</p>

			<h4>Hunting for Ideas</h4>
			<p>Once we understand the problem, we can begin <span class="italicsText">the hunt</span>. This is where we begin looking for possible approaches. Like hunting game, this is arguably the longest and most arduous stage. There is no single way to find these approaches, but there some starting points:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>look at the problem statement and emphasize a part;</li>
				<li>focus on a particular detail; or</li>
				<li>take each detail and arrange them in different orders, and focus on a particular order</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With your focus on a particular term or an arrangement of terms, ask the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are all the possible meanings?</li>
				<li>What does this term or arrangement mean in another area?</li>
				<li>Is there another term or arrangement similar in another area?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Other helpful starting points are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="boldText">Make a guess.</span> For problems of finding, start with a guess, and check it against the data. For problems of proving, there are two approaches:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Assume that the conclusion is true. What would this imply? Is there a contradiction?</li>
					<li>Assume that the conclusion is false. What would this imply? Is there a contradiction?</li>
				</ul>
				<li><span class="boldText">Consider previous approaches</span>. If we've seen a similar problem before, how did we or others approach the problem?</li>
				<li><span class="boldText">Consider all possible approaches</span>. Take a particular part, detail, or set of details, and approach them from different sides. If it's a geometry problem, think of it algebraically. If it's an algebraic problem, think of it geometrically. If it's a set theory problem, think of real world sets.</li>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="boldText">Construct an analogy</span>. A helpful point here is to think of an <span class="italicsText">analogy</span>. An analogy is like similarity. Similar objects agree with each other with respect to some component, analogous objects agree with respect to <span class="italicsText">certain relations</span> between their components.</li>
					<p>With an analogy, we can discover a <span class="italicsText">simpler analogous problem</span>. Solving that problem can lead to a <span class="italicsText">conjecture</span>, a hypothesis. If we prove that the conjecture is true, we have further data to work with, and with further data, there are more possible approaches to consider. In mathematics, when we prove such conjectures, they become <span class="boldText">auxiliary theorems</span> or <span class="boldText">lemmas</span> &mdash; propositions proven so as to find a solution to the original problem.</p>
				</ul>
				<li><span class="boldText">Take details to logical extremes</span>. Take details in the problem and &#8220;stretch&#8221; or &#8220;shrink&#8221; them. If we're given some number ${n,}$ what happens when $n$ is extremely large? What happens when $n$ is extremely small?</li>
				<li><span class="boldText">Use all available data.</span> Often, the failure to find good ideas or approaches is because we haven't used every single piece of data. We should not just limit "data" to what the problem provides. Think about <span class="italicsText">definitions</span> and what given propositions imply.</li>
				<li><span class="boldText">Generalize the problem.</span> When we <span class="italicsText">generalize</span> in mathematics, we first consider a particular mathematical object, then consider the broader set containing that object. For example, suppose we have the following data:</li>
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>${1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100}$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
				<p>We can generalize this data to something like this:</p>
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>${1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 10^2}$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
				<p>Examining this generalization, we might ask if this conjecture is true:</p>
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>${1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \ldots + n^3 = m^2}$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
				<p>Proving the conjecture above may very well lead to not just possible approaches, but remarkable results.</p>
				<li><span class="boldText">Specify the problem.</span> In contrast to generalizing, we can <span class="italicsText">specify</span> the problem. When we specify a problem in mathematics, we take a particular set of objects or cases, and focus on just one particular object or case. Many problems involve superfluous or redundant details. When we remove those details, we often arrive at a much simpler and easier problem to solve.</li>
				<li><span class="boldText">Solve a related problem.</span> If the original problem is too difficult, try and solve a related problem with similar data. Substitute propositions or variables with simpler ones of similar form. This is unlikely to result in a solution to the original problem, but it likely will provide insight.</li>
				<li><span class="boldText">Solve an auxiliary problem.</span> An <span class="boldText">auxiliary problem</span> is a problem we consider in order to gain insight to the original problem. Unlike a related or equivalent problem, auxiliary problems are problems produced from the original problem's data. We can think of them as "component problems" &mdash; they are found by breaking the original problem into smaller pieces. For example, suppose we are asked to solve:</li>
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>${x^4 - 13x^2 + 36 = 0}$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
				<p>We observe that ${x^4 = (x^2)^2.}$ So, we introduce an <span class="boldText">auxiliary unknown</span>: ${y = x^2.}$ This reduces the question to:</p>
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>${y^2 - 13y + 36 = 0.}$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
				<li><span class="boldText">Solve an equivalent problem.</span> Two problems are <span class="italicsText">equivalent</span> if each problem's solution involes the other's solution. Many math problems have equivalent problems that are much easier to solve.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>When we try to solve equivalent problems, we might find them leading to auxiliary problems or other equivalent problems. This is perfectly fine and routine in mathematics. Go down the rabbit hole if need be.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>Note that the hunt often occurs while we're attempting to understand the problem. There are so many questions we can ask during the previous stage that chances are we will stumble upon some good idea. Again, there is no mechanical formula to solving math problems.</p>

			<h4>Execution</h4>
			<p>Once we have a good idea for solving the problem, the next step is to <span class="italicsText">execute</span>. The following should be performed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Answer: How does this idea relate to the problem?</li>
				<li>Carry out all of the necessary computations or inferential steps.</li>
				<li>Verify that each step is valid.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Start from the largest steps (major premises) and work your way down the smallest steps (minor premises and implicit assumptions).</li>
				</ul>
				<li>If possible, check if the steps are intuitive.</li>
			</ul>
