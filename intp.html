					<h3>The Nature of Mathematics</h3>
					<p>If we traced a mathematical field's development far enough down history, we would find its roots in human responses to external stimuli: Geometry and trigonometry grew out of land surveying and astronomy; algebra out of accounting; calculus out of describing the physical world. For some, development was driven by pressing problems. For others, pure curiosity. Regardless of motivation, we harnessed the ability to draw inferences from existing inferences. And it is precisely this ability that creates and enriches more complex mathematical fields &mdash; abstract algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry, topology, the list only grows.</p>
					<p>But why mathematics? A realist would say we do not know. However, to the poetic mathematician, it is arguably because mathematics is the most human response to solving problems.</p>
					<p>When we first encounter a problem, our first reaction is usually to describe it. For example, the Mesapotamians likely noticed that counting in their number system was difficult for large quantities of things. They may have then described the problem: Some numbers were so large that to express them required signaling the absence of a digit. The solution? Use a symbol to represent that absence (we now know this symbol as the number 0). Over time, as we studied the phenomenon of counting, and what 0 means and implies, we began noticing relationships to other ideas: ${x + 0 = x}$; ${0 \cdot x = 0}$; ${x/0 \implies \text{undefined}.}$ </p>
					<p>With enough relationships, we can create a <span class="boldText">mathematical model</span>. To do so, we first start with <span class="boldText">definitions</span> &mdash; statements explicitly assigning meanings to words or symbols. From those definitions, we produce <span class="boldText">axioms</span> &mdash; statements that we presume true without proof (axioms are also referred to as <span class="boldText">postulates</span>). In a sense, axioms are the <span class="italicsText">basic assumptions</span> from which we can draw conclusions, the very inferences that form relationships.</p>
					<p>These conclusions are drawn through the the powerful tools of logical deduction. The conclusions are formally called <span class="boldText">theorems</span> &mdash; statements that we <span class="underlineText">know</span> to be true from the axioms and definitions we started with.</p>
					<p>It is at the theorem juncture that we have the great divide of mathematicians. One camp stops at the juncture, and its members return to the very start of the process to find more theorems elsewhere. These explorers are generally referred to as <span class="italicsText">pure mathematicians</span>. Another camp takes an additional step &mdash; applying the theorems to nature. They take the theorems, and use it in their analysis of <span class="italicsText">data</span>, information from reality. These adventurers are generally referred to as <span class="italicsText">applied mathematicians</span>.</p>
					<p>While being a member of either camp is often fertile ground for jest ("applied mathematics is soft, pure mathematics is reality-detached"), restricting ourselves strictly to one or the other is naive. And in fact, most professional mathematicians will wade into the discoveries of the other camp, even if only in brief. The pure mathematician neglecting application may very well fail to see how her results conflict with the findings from the other camp; an observation that more often than not reveals errors in axioms and definitions, the very foundations of her theorems. The applied mathematician neglecting the work of pure mathematicians will end up misapplying theorems, or worse, attempting to prove theorems that have already been proven. In their toils, both waste the most valuable resource of all &mdash; human time.</p>
					<p>For this reason, the materials that follow explore both purity and application. We will always begin with grounding axioms and definitions, occassionally with an observation from nature for context. We then work our way up to theorems, and end with applications. Following this procedure, we begin by defining <span class="italicsText">mathematical language</span>. More specifically, we will begin with an area more "reality-detached" than pure mathematics itself &mdash; the field of philosophy called <span class="italicsText">logic</span>.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="mathematical_definitions" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Definitions in Mathematics</h4>
					<p>Philosophy has demonstrated time and time again that <span class="italicsText">language</span> grounds knowledge. And to comprehend language, we must know the meanings of the words we use &mdash; <span class="boldText">definitions</span>. There is, however, a dilemma. When we define words, we use other words, and in many instances, we find that our definitions are circular. "Dead" means lifeless, "lifeless" means deprived of life, and "life" means the quality separating an organism from <span class="italicsText">dead</span> bodies. Mathematics suffers the same problem: a "point" is the common part of two intersecting <span class="italicsText">lines</span>, a "line" is the figure traced by a <span class="italicsText">point</span> moving along the shortest path between two <span class="italicsText">points</span>.</p>
					<p>The solution: Take a smaller number of words and declare them <span class="boldText">undefined</span>. This way, we have words that we can use to build definitions, without ever running into the problem of circularity. This medicament is unusual, and it often mildly sickens emigres at first dose. It is, however, what separates philosophy and mathematics from many other fields. Fortunately, time will accustom ourselves to it. As we proceed, whenever we encounter a word taken as undefined, we will explicitly state that it is undefined.</p>
					<p>Whenever we construct definitions in mathematics, we must ensure that they meet the following criteria:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>the definition <span class="italicsText">describes</span> something we have in mind;</li>
						<li>the definition <span class="italicsText">includes</span> all of the cases we have in mind;</li>
						<li>the definition <span class="italicsText">excludes</span> all other cases;</li>
						<li>the definition is <span class="italicsText">meaningful</span>; and</li>
						<li>the definition is <span class="italicsText">consistent</span>.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>For example, we could define a square as "a shape that exists in space." This definition fails the first criterion. It merely tells us that there is such a shape, but it gives us no indication of what that shape is. It does not <span class="italicsText">describe</span> what we have in mind.</p>
					<p>We could define a rectangle as "a four-sided polygon whose vertex angles are right angles, and whose sides are equal." This definition would fail the second criterion, because it excludes non-square rectangles &mdash; it does not <span class="italicsText">include</span> all of the cases we have in mind.</p>
					<p>We may define a square as "a four-sided polygon with equal sides." This definition would fail the third criterion, because it would include rectangles and rhombuses, which are cases we did not have in mind. It does not <span class="italicsText">exclude</span> all other cases.</p>
					<p>We could easily define a square as "a line line line line point point point point." This definition, however, fails the fourth criterion. It is not <span class="italicsText">meaningful</span>.</p>
					<p>Similarly, we could easily define a square as "a four-sided polygon with five equal sides." This definition fails the fifth criterion. It is not <span class="italicsText">consistent</span>.</p>
					<p>A better definition would be define a square as "a four-sided polygon is a square <span class="italicsText">if</span>, and <span class="italicsText">only if</span>, its sides are all equal and its vertex angles are all right angles. The italicized words are logical operators, restricting what constitutes a square to two conditions: (1) "sides are all equal," and (2) "vertex angles all right angles." The "if" tells us that any case satisfying the two conditions is a square, and the "only if" tells us that any case failing any one of those two conditions, is not a square. This definition effectively meets all of the criteria: it is descriptive, it includes all of the cases we have in mind and excludes all others, it is meaninful, and it is consistent.</p>

				<section id="mathematical_propositions" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Propositions in Mathematics</h4>
					<p>Once we have defined words, we can begin to form <span class="italicsText">sentences</span> with those words. If we think about the sentences we use daily, we might observe that there are two kinds, or classes, of sentences: sentences that can be said to be true or false, and sentences that can not. For example, the sentences "Koror is the capital of Palau," and "Dogs are mammals,"  are sentences that can be given the value true or false, and in fact, it is true. However, the sentence "The weather is nice today," is not a sentence that can be given the value true or false &mdash; a hot summer's day is heaven to those of us who surf, but it may very well be hell to our friends nursing hangovers.</p>
					<p>Sentences that can ascribed the value true or false are called <span class="boldText">propositions</span>. For example, the following statements are propositions in mathematics:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>"The sum of the measures of the interior angles of any plane square is equal to 360 degrees." (True).</li>
						<li>${12 + 5 = 11}$. (False).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The following sentences are not propositions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>"Mathematics tastes sweet." (Nonsensical, formally).</li>
						<li>"A triangle consists of three lines and three points." (Vague).</li>
						<li>"It is sunny outside." (Requires us to qualify place).</li>
						<li>${x + 5 = 0}$. (Truth cannot cannot be determined until $x$ is given a value).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We state explicitly here that we've encountered some undefined terms, and they will remain undefined: <span class="italicsText">sentences</span>, <span class="italicsText">true</span> and <span class="italicsText">false</span>.</p>
					<p>From these undefined terms, we state our first axioms:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>There exists a class $C$ of sentences.</li>
						<li>A sentence is a member of $C$ if, and only if, it can be assigned the words <span class="italicsText">true</span> or <span class="italicsText">false</span>.</li>
						<li>The members of $C$ are called <span class="italicsText">propositions</span>.</li>
						<li>Propositions can be assigned one, and only one, of the words <span class="italicsText">true</span> or <span class="italicsText">false</span>.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>We will study what "class" and "members" are shortly.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="notation_propositions" class="grid-item">
					<h5>Notation of Propositions</h5>
					<p>A common practice in mathematics, and many other fields, is to use notation. This is done as a matter of both efficiency and generalization. Accordingly, we represent propositions in mathematics with small letters, the most commonly used being $p$, $q$, $r$, $s$, and $t$.</p>
					<p>We will also represent the values <span class="italicsText">true</span> and <span class="italicsText">false</span> with the capital letters T for true, and F for false. Both T and F are referred to as <span class="boldText">truth values</span>. Thus, when we analyze a proposition $p$, we can say "$p$ has a truth value of T," or "$p$ has a truth value of F."</p>
					<p>In some situations, we will also use the symbol <span class="italicsText">verum</span> for the truth value true: ${\top.}$ And the symbol <span class="italicsText">falsum</span> for the truth value false: ${\bot.}$</p>
				</section>

				<section id="axioms" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Axioms in Mathematics</h4>
					<p>One of chief tasks of mathematics &mdash; one might say <span class="italicsText">the</span> task of mathematics &mdash; is determining the truth values of propositions. This is done by (1) gathering the propositions whose truth values we have determined, then (2) using logic to derive, or evaluate, the truth values of other propositions.</p>
					<p>However, this can only be done if we have some propositions to begin with. Moreover, those propositions, <span class="italicsText">initial propositions</span>, must be true. The trouble is, we cannot evaluate the truth value of these initial propositions because they are <span class="italicsText">the</span> propositions that ignite the whole process.</p>
					<p>The solution: Assume the initial propositions to be true. Accordingly, let's make this clear with a definition. An <span class="boldText">axiom</span> is an initial proposition assumed to be true.</p>
					<p>Here is a famous axiom:</p>
					<blockquote>
						We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness ...

					<h3>Basic Algebra</h3>
					<p>
						Algebra is a necessary component to any meaningful exploration of
						mathematics. For this reason, we must have a strong grounding in
						<span class="boldText">arithmetic rules</span> and
						<span class="boldText">algebraic rules</span> before moving any
						further.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="arithmetic_rules_1" class="grid-item">
					<h3>Arithmetic Rules</h3>
					<p>There are four basic arithmetic operators:</p>
					<figure class="table">
						<table>
							<thead>
								<th>Symbol</th>
								<th>Operation</th>
							</thead>
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td>$a + b$</td>
									<td>Addition</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>$a - b$</td>
									<td>Subtraction</td>

								<tr>
									<td>$a \times b$</td>
									<td>Multiplication</td>

									<td>Division</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>$a^b$</td>
									<td>Exponentiation</td>
								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
						<figcaption>Basic operations</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						In the tables above we used the letters $a$ and $b$. These are
						called <span class="boldText">variables</span> &mdash; simply
						placeholders that we can plug numbers, other variables, or even
						other operations with variables into. Variables allow us to
						<span class="boldText">generalize</span>, or
						<span class="boldText">abstract</span>, statements. For example,
						$2 + 2 = 4$, and $3 + 8 = 11$. We make an abstraction of this
						pattern, or idea, by writing something like $a + b = n$, which tells
						us that, we can plug into $a$ and $b$ numbers we want, and the
						result is another number, $n$.
					</p>
					<p>
						Abstractions are useful because they allow us greater flexibility
						and accuracy with our statements. Suppose we want to say, "I'm
						looking for two numbers that add to 10." We can write: $a + b = 10$.
						This flexibility and accuracy is a powerful tool in mathematics,
						because it gives us plenty of room to write statements that say what
						we can and cannot do &mdash; rules.
					</p>
					<p>
						Understanding the basic rules of arithmetic at a very high level is
						priceless in mathematics. Part of the elegance and power of
						mathematics is that we can arrive at beautiful, and often shocking,
						results from a set of very basic rules.

				<section id="addition_rules" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Addition</h4>
					<p>
						Addition can be thought of as moving to the right along the real
						number line by whatever number we are adding. So, for example, the
						expression $4 + 2$ can be thought of as "Start at 4, and move 2 to
						the right." This give us the final destination of 6. Subtraction is
						really just addition, only instead of moving towards the right, we
						move towards the left. For example, $4 - 3$ is really $4 + (-3)$,
						returning 1. Visually:

				</section>

				<section id="addition_with_zero" class="grid-item">
					<h5>Addition with Zero</h5>
					<p>
						When we add 0 to a number, we are effectively saying "no movement."
						Thus:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>$0 + a = a + 0 = a$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
				</section>

				<section id="subtraction" class="grid-item">
					<h5>Subtraction</h5>
					<p>
						As aforementioned, subtraction is really just adding negative
						numbers. Considering the addition with zero rule, we have the
						following inference:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>$a + (-a) = 0$</p>
							<p>$-a + a = 0$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Given the equation $a + (-a) = 0$, we say that $-a$ is the
						<span class="boldText">additive inverse</span> of $a$.
					</p>
					<p>
						Whenever we see the equation $-a + a = 0$, we should immediately
						become aware that we $a$ and $-a$ are on opposite sides of 0 on the
						real line. Furthermore, because $-a + a = 0$, subtracting $-a$ from
						both sides, we have $-a = -(-a)$.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="commutative_law_of_addition" class="grid-item">
					<h3>Commutative Law of Addition</h3>
					<p>The commutative law of addition states that:</p>
					<figure class="display-math">
						<div>
							<p>$a + b = b + a$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						In other words, the order of terms in addition does not change the
						sum of those terms.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="associative_law_of_addition" class="grid-item">
					<h3>Associative Law of Addition</h3>
					<p>
						The associative law of addition states that the sum of the terms
						does not depend on the order of operations. In other words, we can
						group terms freely:
					</p>
					<figure class="display-math">
						<div>
							<p>(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						The idea is made apparent from a simple analogy. If we want sweet
						iced tea, we can add the tea, then the ice, then the sugar; or we
						can add the sugar, then the ice, then the tea; or we can add the
						tea, then the sugar, then the ice, or we can add the sugar, then the
						tea, then the ice; either or, the result is the same &mdash; sweet
						iced tea.
					</p>
					<p>
						The associative law of addition leads to another useful property:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>If $a + b = 0$, then $b = -a$ and $a = -b$.</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						The above property is the direct result of subtracting either $a$ or
						$b$ from both sides. Combining commutativity and associativity, we
						have the following result:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>$(a - b) + c = (a + (-b)) + c$</p>
							<p>$\phantom{(a - b) + c} = a + (-b + c)$ by associativity</p>
							<p>$\phantom{(a - b) + c} = a + (c - b)$ by commutativity</p>
							<p>$\phantom{(a - b) + c} = (a + c) - b$ by associativity</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
				</section>

				<section id="even_odd_rule_of_minus_signs" class="grid-item">
					<h5>Even-Odd Rule of Minus Signs</h5>
					<p>Given that $a + (-a) = 0$, we can draw yet another inference:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>$a = -(-a)$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Notice that the number of minus signs is even. If we add another
						minus sign:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>$-(-(-a)) = -(a) = -a$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Thus, we can make yet another inference:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>
								Let $a$ be a positive real number, and $x$ be $a$ preceded by
								$n$ minus signs, where $n$ is an integer. If $n$ is even, then
								$x$ is positive (i.e., $a$). If $n$ is odd, then $x$ is negative
								(i.e., $-a$).
							</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
				</section>

				<section id="distributive_law" class="grid-item">
					<h4>The Distributive Law</h4>
					<p>
						With the rules thus far, we can make even further inferences. We
						know that, if ${ a + b = 0 }$, then ${ a = -b }$ and ${ b = -a }$.
						Thus, if ${ a + b = 0 }$, then it must be true that ${ (a + b) + (-a
						- b) = 0 }$, since ${ a + b = 0 }$ and ${ -a - b = 0 }$. If ${ (a +
						b) + (-a-b) = 0 }$, then it follows that ${ a + b - a -b = 0 }$.
						Rearranging the equation, we have ${ a - a + b - b = 0 }$.
						Rearranging again, we have: ${ -(a + b) = -a + (-b) }$. This yields
						the following inference:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${ -(a + b) = -a - b }$.</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						We know this rule as the
						<span class="boldText">distributive law</span>. Note that we
						should always be vigilant about distributing a minus sign to a sum
						involving negative numbers: ${ -(-a) = a }$. To ensure that
						vigilance, we should make the following rules clear:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>
								If ${ a }$ and ${ b }$ are positive integers, then ${ a + b }$
								is a positive integer.
							</p>
							<p>
								If ${ a }$ and ${ b }$ are negative integers, then ${ a + b }$
								is a negative integer.
							</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						We can see that these rules are true with a simple proof. Let ${ a =
						-n }$ and ${ b = -m }$, where ${ m }$ and ${ n }$ are positive. It
						follows then that ${ a + b = -n - m = -(n + m) }$. Since ${ n }$ and
						${ m }$ are positive, ${ n + m }$ is positive. Since ${ n + m }$ is
						positive, it follows that ${ a + b }$ is negative, because ${ n + m
						}$ is positive only if ${ a + b }$ is negative.

					<p>
						Three number relationships are ripe for inferences. If we add ${ -b
						}$ to both sides of the equation, we obtain ${ a + b - b = c - b }$.
						Simplifying, we have ${ a + 0 = c - b }$. We can then infer:

					<h3>The Numbers</h3>
					<p>
						Let's cover some rudimentary rules and definitions about numbers. We
						will often revisit these topics over and over again, as numbers
						cannot be avoided in mathematics.
					</p>

					<h4>Integers</h4>
					<p>
						The <span class="boldText">integers</span> are the whole numbers
						we use for counting, and their opposities:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<p>$ \ldots , -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots $</p>
						<figcaption>The integers</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						The numbers greater than 0 are called the
						<span class="boldText">positive integers</span>:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<p>$ 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots $</p>
						<figcaption>The positive integers</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						The numbers less than 0 are called the
						<span class="boldText">negative integers</span>:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<p>$ \ldots , -4, -3, -2, -1$</p>
						<figcaption>The negative integers</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						<span class="boldText"
							>The number 0 is neither negative nor positive</span
						>. It is both a <span class="boldText">nonpositive</span> and
						<span class="boldText">nonnegative</span> number. Thus, the
						<span class="italicsText">nonpositive integers</span> are the
						negative integers including 0:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<p>$ \ldots , -4, -3, -2, -1, 0$</p>
						<figcaption>The nonpositive integers</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						and the <span class="italicsText">nonnegative integers</span> are
						the positive integers including 0:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<p>$ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$</p>
						<figcaption>The nonnegative integers</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<h4>Rational Numbers</h4>
					<p>
						When we divide one integer by another
						<span class="italicsText">nonzero</span> integer, we get a
						<span class="boldText">rational number</span>. More specifically,
						if, and only if, a number can be written in the form $\frac{a}{b}$,
						where $a$ is an integer and $b$ is a nonzero integer, then the
						number is a rational number. For example, 4 is a rational number,
						since 4 can be written as $\frac{4}{1}$. 0.5 is a rational number,
						since it can be written as $\frac{1}{2}$.
					</p>

					<h4>Irrational Numbers</h4>
					<p>
						If a number cannot be written in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$
						is an integer and $b$ is a nonzero integer, then the number is an
						<span class="boldText">irrational number</span>. For example, the
						number $\pi$ is an irrational number, because it cannot be written
						in the form $\frac{a}{b}$.
					</p>

					<h4>Real Numbers</h4>
					<p>
						All of the numbers above are called
						<span class="boldText">real numbers</span>. In the simplest
						terms, a <span class="italicsText">real number</span> is a number
						that can be written as a decimal. Thus, 7 is a real number, since $7
						= 7.0$. Similarly, while $pi$ is an irrational number, it is a
						<span class="italicsText">real number</span> since it can be written
						as a decimal ($3.14 \ldots$), albeit non-terminating.
					</p>

					<h4>Imaginary Numbers</h4>
					<p>
						Outside of the real numbers, we have the imaginary numbers. These
						are the numbers that result from operations such as $\sqrt{-1}$.
						These will be covered in more detail later on.
					</p>

					<h4>The Decimal System</h4>
					<p>
						Real numbers are written in
						<span class="boldText">decimal notation</span>. This is the
						prevailing standard (with the exception of
						<span class="boldText">binary</span>, which is favored by
						computers). The decimal system is useful because it allows us to
						quickly add numbers through the process of
						<span class="italicsText">carrying over</span>. For example:

					<p><span class="exh">Exercise</span>. Numbers consisting entirely of the digit "8" are added, resulting in the sum 1000. What are these numbers?</p>
						<details class="answer">
							<summary>Solution</summary>
							<p>First, assume the following:</p>
							<figure>
								$$ \begin{matrix} \begin{alignedat}{8} \ldots 8 \\ \ldots \\ +
								\space \ldots 8 \\ \hline 1000 \end{alignedat} \end{matrix} $$
							</figure>
							<p>What we know:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Each number ends with an 8.</li>
								<li>
									Since the sum is 1000, the sum of the last digit, an 8, is 0.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								How many 8s do we need to arrive at a sum where the last digit is 0?
								At least five 8s, since $8 \times 5 = 40$. Thus, we have:
							</p>
							<figure>
								$$ \begin{matrix} \begin{alignedat}{8} \ldots 8 \\ \ldots 8 \\
								\ldots 8 \\ \ldots 8 \\ + \space \ldots 8 \\ \hline 1000
								\end{alignedat} \end{matrix} $$
							</figure>
							<p>
								Now note that there is a 4 that must be carried to the next place.
								To keep the sum's digits 0, we need a sum of 8s and a 4 that returns
								the last digit 0. We know that $8 + 8 + 4 = 20$. Further, we need
								one more 8 to get a 10:
							</p>
							<figure>
								$$ \begin{matrix} \begin{alignedat}{8} 8 \\ 8 \\ 8 \\ 88 \\ + \space
								888 \\ \hline 1000 \end{alignedat} \end{matrix} $$

					<p>The $A$s denote some digit, the $B$s denote another digit, and $C$ denotes a third digit. What are these digits?</p>
						<details class="answer">
							<summary>Solution</summary>
							<p>
								To start, we are looking for a number where $A + B = nC$, where $n$
								and $C$ are digits. Furthermore, $A + B + n = mA$, where $m$ and $A$
								are digits. Then, $m + A + B = AAA$.

								First, we note that $A + B$ must result in a two digit number.
								Second, we further note that $A$ appears in the thousands position
								of the result ($AAAC$). Because $A$ appears in the thousands place,
								no other digit can be carried over into the thousands place.

								There is only one number for $B$ that can satisfy these conditions

						<details class="answer">
							<summary>Solution</summary>
							<p>
								First, $715 \times 1001 = 715715$. We can see this with the
								multiplication algorithm:
							</p>
							<figure>
								$$ \begin{array}{cc} & & & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \times & & & & 7 & 1 & 5
								\\ \hline & & & 5 & 0 & 0 & 5 \\ & & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ + & 7 & 0 & 0
								& 7 \\ \hline & 7 & 1 & 5 & 7 & 1 & 5 \end{array} $$
							</figure>
							<p>
								Under the multiplication algorithm, Daniel simply takes the three
								digits, ABC, and performs the following:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>$C00C$</li>
								<li>$B00B$</li>
								<li>$A00A$</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								Then, he adds the numbers, shifting one place to the left on each

								$$ \begin{array}{cc} & & & C & 0 & 0 & C \\ & & B & 0 & 0 & B \\ + &
								A & 0 & 0 & A \\ \hline & A & B & C & A & B & C \end{array} $$
							</figure>
							<p>
								The result then is $ABCABC$, a repetition of the digits $ABC$. Note
								further that there are two 0s, and the digits are repeated twice.

					<p><span class="exh">Exercise</span>. Compute $1010101010 \times 57$.</p>

								The multiplication algorithm tells us that we are simply shifting

								$$ \begin{array}{cc} & 01 & 01 & 01 & 01 & 01 & 01 \\ & & & & & & 57

					<h3>The Division Algorithm</h3>
					<p>Among the operations, division is the most complicated.</p>
					<p><span class="exh">Exercise</span>. A six-digit number having 1 as its leftmost digit becomes three times bigger if we take this digit off and put it at the end of the number. What is this number?</p>
						<details class="answer">

							<p>Rewrite this with the multiplication algorithm:</p>
							<figure>

								\hline A & B & C & D & E & 1 \end{array} $$
							</figure>
							<p>
								Let's focus on $E$. We need a digit $E$ where $3 \times E = n1$,
								where $n$ is a digit. This digit must be 7, for $7 \times 3 = 21$.
							</p>
							<p>
								We know that $E$ is 7, so what might $D$ be? Well, we need a digit
								$D$ where $(D \times 3) + 2 = 7$. Or, rearranging, $D \times 3 = 5$.
								The only digit that would satisfy this condition is $D = 5$ (since
								$3 \times 5 + 2 = 17$.
							</p>
							<p>
								We know that $D$ is 5, so now we look at $C$. We need a digit $C$
								such that $(C \times 3) + 1 = 5$, or, rearranging, $C \times 3 = 4$.
								There is only one digit that satisfies this condition, 8. Thus, $C =
								8$.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now we look at $B$. What digit satisfies the condition $B \times 3 =
								6$? It must be 2. Therefore, $B = 2$.
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, we look at $A$. What digit results in $A \times 3 = 12$. It
								must be 4, since $3 \times 4 = 12$. Hence, the digits are $A = 4$,
								$B = 2$, $C = 8$, and $D = 5$.

							</p>
							<p>
								This also tells us that after every six 0s, we return to 10. Thus,

							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Lap 1 (six 0s): 142857 remainder 1</li>

								<li>Lap 5 (twenty 0s): 142857 142857 14 remainder 2</li>

					<h3>Order of Operations</h3>
					<p>Arithmetic allows us to combine numbers, through the operations listed above, to form other numbers. The way we order operations matters in mathematics. Otherwise, we run into problems. For example, consider the following:</p>
					<figure>
						<p>$2 + 3 \times 4$</p>
						<figcaption>Multiple operations</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>What does this expression mean? Well, it could be: (1) Add 2 and 3, then (2) multiply the sum by 4. Or, it could mean: (1) Multiply 3 and 4, and (2) add 2 to the product. This ambiguity is unacceptable in mathematics. We need be clear and precise with our words. For these reason, mathematics follows a few conventions on how to write mathematical expressions:</p>
					<figure>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Evaluate expressions in parentheses first, working from the
								inner most to the outer most, applying all of these rules.
							</li>
							<li>Perform all exponentiations.</li>
							<li>
								Perform all multiplications and divisions from left to right.
							</li>
							<li>
								Perform all additions and subtractions from left to right.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<figcaption>The order of operations</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>The conventions above are collectively called the <span class="boldText">order of operations</span>. Again, these are conventions. They are not universal truths; they're simply what mathematicians have come to agree to about how mathematics is communicated and understood.</p>
					<p><span class="topic">Operations as Trees.</span> One way to think about the order of operations is that it is a way for us to distinguish between different "trees" (the diagrams below are called <span class="boldText">binary trees</span>, to be covered in further detail in later sections). For example, suppose we had the following expression:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${2 \times 4 + 6}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Without the order of operations, the expression above could be $(2 \times 4)+6$, which can be visualized as:</p>
					<figure>
						<img
							src="images/orderOperations_binaryTree1.svg"
							alt="binary tree"
							class="forty-p"
							loading="lazy"
						/>
					</figure>
					<p>Or, it could be $2 \times (4+6)$:</p>
					<figure>
						<img
							src="images/orderOperations_binaryTree2.svg"
							alt="binary tree"
							class="forty-p"
							loading="lazy"
						/>

					<h3>Preface</h3>
					<p>Studying Euclidean geometry in foundational mathematics is a tradition that dates back to the Ancient greeks. As a nod to this tradition, we explore the material in the following sections.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="segment_rays_and_distance" class="grid-item">
					<h3>Basic Definitions</h3>
					<p>The simplest figure in geometry is a <span class="boldText">point</span>. All figures in geometry consist of points. The set of <span class="underlineText">all</span> points is called <span class="boldText">space</span>. A point does not have a size, but it is represented by a dot. We generally name points with capital letters. Points placed contiguously form a <span class="boldText">line</span>, which extends in two opposite directions without ending. We denote a line with an italicized or cursive lower case letter (e.g., $\ell$):</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/line_AB.svg" alt="a line" class="sixty-p">
					</figure>
					<p>Points on the same line, such as $A$ and $B$ above, are said to be <span class="boldText">collinear</span>. Points that are not on the same line are <span class="boldText">noncollinear</span>.</p>
					<p>A <span class="boldText">plane</span> is a flat, two-dimensional surface, consisting of points, that extends infinitely in all directions. Like points, we denote planes with a capital letter (e.g., <span class="italicsText">Plane N</span>). We can visualize a plane as:</p>
					<figure><img src="images/plane_N.svg" alt="a plane" class="quarter-p"></figure>
					<p>Points on the sample plane are described as <span class="boldText">coplanar</span>, while points not on the sample plane are <span class="boldText">noncoplanar</span>.</p>
					<p>When to figures (whether a plane or a line) meet, or cut one another, they are said to <span class="boldText">intersect</span>. The <span class="boldText">intersection</span> of two figures is the set of points that are in both figures:</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/intersection_lines.svg" alt="lines intersecting" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy">
					</figure>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/intersecting_planes.svg" alt="intersecting planes" class="fifty-p" loading="lazy">
					</figure>
					<p>The beauty of Euclidean geometry is that it begins with just a few definitions and axioms, then deduces increasingly complex conclusions, or theorems, from those axioms. The first definition we cover is a <span class="boldText">line segment</span>. Given two points, $A$ and $C$, all of the points between $A$ and $C$, including the <span class="italicsText">endpoints</span> $A$ and $C$, form a <span class="boldText">line segment</span>. We denote the line segment as ${\overline{\rm AC}.}$ Visually:</p>
					<figure><img src="images/line_segment_AC.svg" alt="line segment" class="seventy-p" loading="lazy"></figure>
					<p>Given a point $A$, a <span class="boldText">ray</span> is a part of a line beginning with point $A$, with no endpoint. We represent rays with an overline right arrow: ${\overrightarrow{\rm AB}.}$ Visually:</p>
					<figure><img src="images/ray_AB.svg" alt="ray" class="fifty-p" loading="lazy"></figure>
				</section>

				<section id="ruler_addition_postulate" class="grid-item">
					<h4>The Ruler Postulate</h4>
					<p>The <span class="boldText">Ruler Postulate</span> states: The points on a line can be paired with real numbers, such that any two points can have coordinates 0 and 1. Given coordiantes, the distance between two any two points is the absolute value of the difference of their coordinates.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="segment_addition_postulate" class="grid-item">
					<h4>The Segment Addition Postulate</h4>
					<p>The <span class="boldText">Segment Addition Postulate</span> states: Given a point $B$ between points $A$ and $C$, ${\overline{\rm AB} + \overline{\rm BC} = \overline{\rm AC}.}$</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/segment_addition_postulate.svg" alt="segment addition" class="fifty-p" loading="lazy">
					</figure>
					<p>Two objects that have the same size and shape are <span class="boldText">congruent</span>. Thus, <span class="italicsText">congruent segments</span> are segments that have equal lengths. If two segments, ${\overline{\rm AB}}$ and ${\overline{\rm CD}}$, have equal lengths, we write ${\overline{\rm AB} = \overline{\rm CD}.}$ If the segments are congruent, we write ${\overline{\rm AB} \cong \overline{\rm CD}.}$ Note that these two terms are equivalent for line segments. If ${\overline{\rm AB}}$ has the same length as ${\overline{\rm BC},}$ it follows that ${\overline{\rm AB}}$ and ${\overline{\rm CD}}$ are congruent to one another.</p>
					<p>The <span class="boldText">bisector of a segment</span> is a line, segment, ray, or plane that intersects a line segment at its midpoint:</p>
					<figure><img src="images/bisector_segment.svg" alt="bisector" class="fifty-p" loading="lazy"></figure>
					<p>In the figure above, the ray ${\overrightarrow{\rm CD}}$ bisects the segment ${\overline{\rm AB}.}$ Where the the bisector intersects the line segment is the <span class="boldText">midpoint</span> of the line segment.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="angles" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Angles</h4>
					<p>An <span class="boldText">angle</span> is the figure resulting from two rays extending from the same endpoint. The two rays are called the <span class="boldText">sides</span> of the angle, and their common endpoint is called the <span class="boldText">vertex</span> of the angle:</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/angle.svg" alt="basic angle" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy">
					</figure>
					<p>In the figure above, the angle $\theta$ is formed from the rays ${\overrightarrow{\rm BA}}$ and ${\overrightarrow{\rm BC}.}$ We denote angles with a miniature angle, followed by the angle's name, or, three points forming the angle, or the vertex. E.g., ${\angle \theta}$ or ${\angle ABC}$ or ${\angle B.}$</p>
					<p>Angles are measured relative to a circle centered at the angle's vertex. The units of measurement are either <span class="boldText">degrees</span> or <span class="boldText">radians</span>. In degrees, a circle has a total of 360 degrees (${360^\circ}$). In radians, a circle has a total of ${2 \pi}$ radians (${2 \pi \text{ rad.}}$) Following these units, angles are classified into various types. Suppose that $\theta$ is an angle:</p>
					<figure class="table"><table>

					<h2>Discrete Mathematics</h2>
					<p><span class="boldText">Discrete mathematics</span> is the mathematics of discrete and finite mathematical objects. Mathematical objects are abstract concepts &mdash; concepts like numbers, functions, triangles, matrices, groups, vector spaces, series, etc. Unlike what we might think of when we hear the word "object" &mdash; maybe a car, a table, or a molecule &mdash; mathematical objects are not physical. They do not move; they do not change over time; and they do not physically interact with real world entities.</p>
					<p>We can classify mathematical objects into two categories: (1) discrete (i.e., finite) and (2) continuous (i.e., infinite). Discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics separate from <span class="italicsText">continuous mathematics</span>, which concerns infinite, or continuous, mathematical objects. This difference might seem vague at the moment, but this is expected. The distinction can only be clarified with experience in both areas.</p>
					<p>All ideas in mathematics, discrete or continuous, are discovered<sup>1</sup> through <span class="boldText">logic</span>. Accordingly, a strong logic background is invaluable to any serious student of mathematics. As we study logic, we might find ourselves asking questions about knowledge and truth. Play with those questions. They are a strong indicator of encountering a link between philosophy and mathematics. Because these questions are excellent opportunities for deeper and playful thinking, the text will occassionally present difficult questions that may or may not have any clear answers.</p>

					<h3>Variables &amp; Statements</h3>
					<p><span class="topic">Variables.</span> In mathematics, we use <span class="boldText">variables</span> as placeholders, or temporary names. Variables allow us to both <span class="italicsText">abstract</span> problems and perform concrete computations of abstractions. For example: "Is there a number where tripling it and adding one is the same as squaring?" While this may seem verbose for some, it was how mathematics was done up until the 16th century &mdash; most everything was in prose. Queue the variable:</p>
					<figure>${ 3x + 1 = x^2 }$</figure>
					<p>The above equation reduces a string of 72 characters down to just 12, while retaining the original string's meaning. Variables are indispensible to mathematics and related fields like computer science.</p>
					<details open>
						<summary>Examples</summary>
						<ol>
							<li>
								"Are there numbers with the property that the sum of their
								squares equals the square of their sum?"
							</li>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Are there numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2$
									?
								</li>
							</ul>
							<li>"Given any real number, its square is nonnegative."</li>
							<ul>
								<li>For any real number $x$, $x^2 \geq 0$.</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
					</details>
					<p><span class="topic">Universal Statements.</span>A <span class="boldText">universal statement</span> is a statement that claims: A certain property is true for all elements in a set.</p>
					<p>For example, "All negative numbers are less than 0." This is a universal statement. It states a property, "less than 0," is true for all elements in a set, "all negative numbers." Universal statements are used beyond mathematics as well. "All cats are mammals" is another example.</p>

					<p><span class="topic">Conditional Statements.</span> A <span class="boldText">conditional statement</span> is a statement that claims: <span class="underlineText">If</span> one thing is true, <span class="underlineText">then</span> some other thing must also be true.</p>
					<p>For example, the statement "If a number is divisible by 6, then it is also divisible by 3," is a conditional statement. We use conditional statements all the time: "If I do my homework, then I can play Madden."</p>

					<p><span class="topic">Existential Statements.</span> An <span class="boldText">existential statement</span> is a statement that claims, "There is at least one thing for which this property is true." That property may or may be true for <span class="italicsText">all</span> things, but the existential statement says, "Maybe not for all, but there is at least one."</p>
					<p>For example, "There is a prime number that is even." This is an existential statement, since it claims that there is at least one thing, "a prime number," for which the property, "is even", is true.  Another example: "Some people hate mayonnaise" is an existential statement, since it claims that there is <span class="italicsText">at lease one</span> person who hates mayonnaise.</p>

					<p><span class="topic">Universal Conditional Statements.</span> A <span class="boldText">universal conditional statement</span> is a statement that claims: "For all of these things, if this is true, then that is true." In other words, the <span class="italicsText">universal conditional</span> is a statement that is both conditional <span class="italicsText">and</span> universal.</p>
					<p>For example, "For all U.S. citizens, if a citizen is not at least 18, then the citizen cannot vote" is a universal conditional statement. It contains a universal statement, "For all U.S.  citizens," and a conditional, "if a citizen is not at least 18, then the citizen cannot vote."</p>

					<p><span class="topic">Universal Existential Statements.</span> A <span class="boldText">universal existential statement</span> is a statement that claims: "For all of these particular things, there is a property that is true for them."</p>
					<p>For example, the statement, "Every real number has an additive inverse" is a universal exisential statement. It claims that for all these particular things ("real numbers"), there is a property ("has an additive inverse"), that is true for them. Another example: "All humans need sleep." The statement is universal ("all humans"), and it asserts the existence of something ("sleep").</p>

					<p><span class="topic">Existential Universal Statements.</span> An <span class="boldText">existential universal statement</span> is a statement that claims: "There is a thing that satisfies a property for all things of a particular kind." The statement asserts existence (there is a thing), and it asserts universality (a property of <span class="italicsText">all</span> things).</p>
					<p>For example: "There is a positive integer that is less than or equal to every positive integer." This is an existential universal statement. Another example: "There is a chemical that is toxic to all people."</p>
				</section>

				<section id="set_theory" class="grid-item">
					<h3>Set Theory</h3>
					<p>In mathematics, a <span class="boldText">set</span> is a collection of elements. For example, the set of all coins includes nickels, sterling, and yen. The set of all countries includes Japan, Palau, and Uruguay. The set of all integers includes 1 and -117. We can visualize a set as:</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/set_intro.svg" alt="simple set" class="seventy-p" loading="lazy"/>
					</figure>
					<p>Sets can be finite (there are only so many countries), or infinite (there are infinitely many of numbers).</p>

					<p><span class="topic">Set Roster Notation.</span> To more efficiently discuss sets, mathematicians have come up with <span class="boldText">set notation</span>. Let's go over some of the most common notation.</p>
					<p>Suppose that $S$ is a set. The notation $x \in S$ means "$x$ is an element of $S$." A set may be made more explicit through <span class="boldText">set roster notation</span>. For instance, $\{ 0, 1, 2 \}$ is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2. If the set has too many elements to list, ellipses may be used. For example, the set of all integers from 0 to 100 may be written as: $\{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots , 100 \}$. Likewise, the set of all positive integers may be written as $\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$.</p>

					<p><span class="topic">Set Builder Notation.</span> We can also specify sets in <span class="boldText">set builder notation</span>. Suppose that $S$ is a set, and $P(x)$ is a property that elements of $S$ may or may not satisfy. We can define a new set that contains all the elements of $S$ such that $P(x)$ is true:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${ \{ x \in S \mid P(x) \} }$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>The pipe character, |, is shorthand for "such that." Thus, above notation refers to all the elements of $S$ with the property $P(x)$. Note that in some mathematical contexts, the phrase "such that" is often abbreviated "s.t." or $\ni$. Thus, the above set may appear in some texts as:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>$$ \{ x \in S \ni P(x) \}, \space \text{or} \\[1em] \{ x \in S \text{ s.t. } P(x) \} $$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>

					<p><span class="topic">The Axiom of Extension.</span> The <span class="boldText">axiom of extension</span> provides that a set is completely determined by what its elements are &mdash; it is irrelevant whether the elements are in order, or whether an element is listed more than once.</p>
					<p>For example, the set $\{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ is the same as the set $\{ 2, 1, 3 \}$, and the same set as $\{ 2, 2, 3, 1 \}$.</p>

					<p><span class="topic">Subsets.</span> Some sets are themselves elements of another set. These sets are called <span class="boldText">subsets</span>. More formally, suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. The set $A$ is a <span class="italicsText">subset</span> of $B$ if, and only if, <span class="underlineText">every</span> element of $A$ is also an element of $B$. To denote this relationship, we write:</p>
					<figure>$$ A \subseteq B $$</figure>
					<p>If $A \subseteq B$ is true, then we can infer: For every element $x$, if $x \in A$, then $x \in B$. We describe $A$ and $B$'s relationship with statements such as "$A$ is contained in $B$" and "$B$ contains $A$."</p>
					<p>If $A$ is not a subset of $B$, then we write:</p>
					<figure>$$ A \nsubseteq B $$</figure>
					<p>If $A \nsubseteq B$ is true, then we can infer: There is at least one element $x$ such that $x \in A$ and $x \notin B$. In other words, if $A$ is not a subset of $B$, then there is at least one element in $A$ that is not an element of B.</p>

					<p><span class="topic">Proper Subsets.</span> Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are sets. $A$ is a <span class="boldText">proper subset</span> of $B$ if, and only if, every element of $A$ is in $B$, but there is at least one element in $B$ that is not in $A$. If $A$ is a proper subset of $B$, we write:</p>
					<figure>$$ A \subset B $$</figure>
					<p>If $A \subset B$ is true, we can infer: All of the elements of $A$ are elements of $B$, but there is at least one element of $B$ that is not an element of $A$.</p>
					<p>If $A \subset B$ is false (i.e., $A$ is not a proper subset of $B$), we write:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${ A \not\subset B }$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>If $A \not\subset B$ is true, then either $A \not\subseteq B$ is true, or $A \subseteq B$ is true, but no elements in $B$ are not in $A$. </p>

					<p>The number 0 is the middle point of the number line, and because of that property, we refer to it as the <span class="boldText">origin</span>. Every number to the left of 0 is a a negative number. Every number to the right is a positive number. 0 itself is neither positive nor negative.</p>
					<p>The real number line is <span class="boldText">continuous</span> because it has no holes (i.e., areas where there is nothing). There are points all along the number line.

					<p>Some of the numbers are separated from one another at specific, constant distances. For example, the set of integers consists of numbers separated by exactly 1 unit of distance.

				<section id="ordered_pairs" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Ordered Pairs</h4>
					<p>When set theory was first introduced, it faced a major issue &mdash; how do you represent ordered pairs? The axiom of extension renders order irrelevant for defining sets. For example, $\{ a, b \}$ is the same set as $\{ b, a \}$. This is problematic if we are referring specifically to "$a$ then b", rather than "$b$ then $a$."</p>
					<p>The patch was to define ordered pairs as sets. An ordered pair is a set of the form $\{ \{ a \}, \{ a, b \} \}$. The set has two elements: $\{ a \}$ and $\{ a, b \}$. If $a \neq b$, then the two sets are distinct, and $a$ is in both sets but $b$ is not. With this definition, we can differentiate between $a$, and $b$. If $a = b$, then we can say that $a$ is both the first and second element of the pair.</p>
					<p>Eventually, however, mathematicians learned that writing $\{ \{ a \}, \{ a,b \} \mid a = b \}$ was too cumbersome. So, the syntax was shortened: $(a, b)$.</p>
					<p>Formalizing the discussion above: Let $a$ and $b$ be elements. The notation $(a, b)$ means the <span class="boldText">ordered pair</span> consisting of $a$ and $b$ together, such that $a$ is the first element of the pair and $b$ is the second element.</p>

					<p><span class="topic">Equality of Ordered Pairs.</span> Suppose $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ are ordered pairs. The ordered pairs are equal if, and only if, $a = c$ and $b = d$. Thus, the statement $(a, b) = (c, d)$ implies that $a = c$ and $b = d$.</p>

				<section id="relations" class="grid-item">
					<h3>Relations</h3>
					<p>As humans, we perceive the world according to the way things relate to one another. Corporate hierarchy, family relationships, friend networks, court systems, if-then, if-and-only-if, cause and effect, these are all relationships. Mathematical objects are no different &mdash; they too have relationships to other mathematical objects.  The set $A$ is related to the set $B$ if ${ A \subseteq B }$. The number $a$ is related to the number $b$ if ${ a < b }$, or if ${ a^2 + b^2 = 1 }$.</p>
					<p>In mathematics, if a mathematical object $x$ is related to a mathematical object ${y,}$ we write:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${ x \mathrel{R} y }$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>To denote "$x$ is related to $y$." If $x$ is not related to $y$, we write:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${x \not\mathrel{R} y }$.</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>For example, suppose we have two sets: ${A = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}}$ and ${B = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}}$. Suppose that an element ${a \in A}$ is related to an element ${b \in B}$, if, and only if, ${a < b}$. From this rule, we can infer: ${0 \mathrel{R} 1}$ since ${0 < 1}$; ${0 \mathrel{R} 2}$, since ${0 < 3}$; ${1 \mathrel{R} 2}$, since ${1 < 2}$; ${1 \mathrel{R} 3}$, since ${1 < 3}$; and ${2 \mathrel{R} 3}$ since ${2 < 3}$. But: ${1 \not\mathrel{R} 1}$, since ${1 \nless 1}$; ${2 \not\mathrel{R} 1}$, since ${2 \nless 1}$, and ${2 \not\mathrel{R} 2}$, since ${2 \nless 2}$.</p>

					<p><span class="topic">Cartesian Products and Relations.</span> Recall: Given two sets $A$ and $B$, the <span class="italicsText">Cartesian product</span> ${A \times B}$ is the set of all ordered pairs ${(x, y)}$ such that ${x \in A}$ and ${y \in B}$. Or, more formally:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>
								${A \times B = \{ (x,y) \mid x \in A \text{ and } y \in B \}}$.
							</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>So, suppose we had two simple sets:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${A = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}}$</p>
							<p>${B = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>The Cartesian product ${A \times B}$ is:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>
								$A \times B = \{ (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3),
								(2,1), (2,2), (2,3) \}$.
							</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>If we know what ordered pairs are members of ${A \times B}$, then we know which elements of $A$ are related to which elements of $B$ and vice versa. More formally, suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. A <span class="boldText">relation $R$</span> from $A$ to $B$ is a subset of ${A \times B}$. Or, in set notation, ${A \mathrel{R} B \subseteq A \times B}$. Given ${(x,y) \in A \times B}$, $x$ is related to $y$ by $\mathrel{R}$ (${x \mathrel{R} y}$) if, and only if, ${(x,y) \in \mathrel{R}}$. The set $A$ is called the <span class="boldText">domain</span> of $R$, and the set $B$ is called the <span class="boldText">codomain</span> of $R$.</p>
					<p>Given sets $x$ and $y$ related by a relation $R$, we denote the domain and codomain of a relation with the notation:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>
								${\mathrel{R} : x \mapsto y }$, where $x$ is the domain, and $y$
								is the codomain.
							</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Thus, whenever we see the notation ${x \mathrel{R} y}$, we can infer that ${(x,y) \in \mathrel{R}}$. And whenever we see the notation ${x \not\mathrel{R} y}$, we can infer that ${(x,y) \notin \mathrel{R}}$.</p>

				<section id="functions_formula_defined" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Functions Defined by Formulas</h4>
					<p>We often define functions in mathematics with formulas. For example, the <span class="boldText">squaring function</span> $f$ from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ is defined by the formula ${f(x) = x^2}$ for every ${x \in \mathbb{R}.}$ Whatever real number is substituted for $x$, the output of $f$ will be the square of that number (${f: x \mapsto x^2.}$)</p>
					<p>Likewise, the <span class="boldText">successor function</span> $g$ from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}$ is defined by the formula ${g(n) = n + 1.}$ Thus, whatever integer is substituted for $n$, the output of $g$ is the number plus 1.</p>
					<p>While functions are often defined by formulas, we should remember that they are just relations, which are in turn just subsets of a Cartesian product. Thus, if $f$ and $g$ ad functions from a set $A$ to a set $B$, then:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>${f = \{ (x,y) \in A \times B \mid y = f(x) \}}$</li>
						<li>${g = \{ (x,y) \in A \times B \mid y = g(x) \}}$</li>

					<p>Given this fact, it follows that: ${f = g \iff f(x) = g(x) \text{ for all } x \in A.}$</p>

				</section>

				<section id="logical_form_and_logical_equivalence" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Arguments</h4>
					<p>An <span class="boldText">argument</span> is a sequence of statements leading to an assertion. The assertion at the end of the sequence is called the <span class="boldText">conclusion</span>, and the preceding statements are called <span class="boldText">premises</span>.</p>

						<li>The argument's <span class="italicsText">form</span>.</li>

					<p>Logical analysis has no business, and provides no help, with an argument's intrinsic merits. Where it does help, however, is determining whether a conclusion <span class="italicsText">necessarily</span> follows from the <span class="italicsText">truth</span> of the premises.</p>
					<p>For example, consider the argument: "If taxes are raised, then unemployment increases. If unemployment increases, then government expenditures increase. Since government expenditures did not increase, taxes were not raised." Strictly from a logical analysis, there are no problems with this argument. But, there may be problems with the argument's intrinsic merits (is it not the case that government expenditures can go unchanged, or even decrease, while taxes are raised?). Logic does not help determine whether the argument's premises are true (Is it true that raising taxes increases unemployment? Is it true that increased unemployment leads to increased government expenditures?). Logic can help determine whether the premises are conclusions that necessarily follow from other premises, but without more, logical analysis provides no aid here.</p>

					<h4>Logical Statements</h4>
					<p>Arguments consist of <span class="boldText">propositions</span> &mdash; sentences that can be assigned the values <span class="italicsText">true</span> or <span class="italicsText">false</span>, but not both. The entirety of mathematics is composed of terms defined by using terms previously defined. This process of using terms to define terms, however, had to start somewhere. For this reason, there are a few terms in mathematics taken to be <span class="italicsText">undefined</span>. The terms <span class="italicsText">sentence</span>, <span class="italicsText">true</span>, and <span class="italicsText">false</span>, are examples of undefined terms in mathematics.</p>

						<li>${1 + 1 = 2}$ (true)</li>
						<li>${2^2 = 18}$ (false)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The sentence ${x^2 = 16}$ is not a proposition, because we cannot assign it the value true or false unless we provide some value for $x$. It is both true or false, depending on $x$.</p>

					<h4>Logical Equivalence &amp; Propositional Forms</h4>
					<p>Given propositions $p$ and $q$, we can use logical connectives to construct the compound propositions ${\neg p}$, ${p \land q}$, and ${p \lor q.}$ Compound propositions themselves can be connected to form more complicated expressions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>${\neg p \lor q}$</li>
						<li>${(\neg p \lor q) \land \neg (p \lor q)}$</li>
						<li>${\neg ((p \land q) \lor (p \land (p \lor \neg q)))}$</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These complicated expressions are called <span class="boldText">propositional forms</span>. When determining a propositional form's truth value, we follow the <span class="italicsText">Boolean order of operations</span>:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Expressions inside brackets/parentheses are performed first</li>
						<li>The <span class="monoText">NOT</span> operator is performed second.</li>
						<li>The operator <span class="monoText">AND</span> is performed third.</li>
						<li>The operator <span class="monoText">OR</span> is performed last.</li>
					</ol>
					<p><span class="topic">Logical Equivalence.</span> The statements "2 is greater than 1" and "1 is less than 2" are two different ways of saying the same thing. This is because of the definitions of the words &#8220;greater than&#8221; and &#8220;less than.&#8221; Both statements, together, can only be: (1) both true, or (2) both false. In other words, if the statements were connected with a logical connective and evaluated in a truth table, their truth values would be identical.</p>
					<p>For example, suppose $p$ and $q$ are propositions. The compound propositions ${p \land q}$ and ${q \land p}$ have the same truth values:</p>

I.e., "Apples are NOT red BUT sweet"; "Apples are red BUT NOT sweet"; "Apples are NOT red AND are NOT sweet." These propositions can be reduced to a single proposition: "Apples are NOT red OR are NOT sweet."</p>
					<p>Similarly, consider the proposition: "Apples are red OR green." Like the <span class="monoText">AND</span> proposition above, this is a compound proposition: (1) "Apples are red." (2) "Apples are green." Thus, for the compound proposition to be false, both (1) and (2) must be false, because an <span class="monoText">OR</span> proposition is false if, and only if, both of its component propositions are false. The negation then is: "Apples are NOT red AND are NOT green."</p>

					<p><span class="topic">De Morgan's Laws and Compound Inequalities.</span> Negating compound inequalities is a common source of error for novices. Confronted with an inequality of the form ${x < y \leq z}$, it is tempting to write: ${x \nless y \nleq z.}$ Temptation be gone! This is <span class="underlineText">wrong</span>.</p>
					<p>Suppose a compound inequality of the form ${x \stackrel{?}= y \stackrel{?}= z}$ (the symbol ${\stackrel{?}=}$ means "unknown relation," and represents the possibility of any of the relation symbols $=$, $>$, $<$, $\leq$, $\geq$, etc.). This compound inequality consists of two component propositions:</p> 
					<ol>
						<li>${x \stackrel{?}= y}$ <span class="monoText">AND</span></li>
						<li>${y \stackrel{?}= z.}$</li>

					<p>Thus, the negation of the compound inequality is:</p>

						<li>${\neg (x \stackrel{?}= y)}$ <span class="monoText">OR</span></li>
						<li>${\neg (y \stackrel{?}= z).}$</li>

					<p>Proposition (1), ${x \nless y,}$ means that ${x \geq y}$. Proposition (2), ${x \nleq z,}$ means that ${y > z.}$ Thus, the negation of the proposition, reduced, is:</p>
					<ol>

					<p>As an aside, the last example might spark some thought about how we assign truth values to propositions. Consider for example Immanuel Kant's observation of three values: the "alive," the "dead," and somewhere in the middle, the "undead." Is there any relationship between the fact that these terms exist and how we evaluate the truth values of propositions? If the answer is yes, does the relationship affect the proposition that such a relationship exists?</p>

					<h3>Arguments</h3>
					<p>An <span class="boldText">argument</span> is a sequence of propositions leading to a conclusion. Needless to say, arguments are the building blocks of mathematics, so their careful study is indispensable to any budding mathematician. Arguments have strict terminology that we must always keep in mind when we evaluate them.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="logic_intro" class="grid-item">
					<p><span class="topic">Arguments: Form v. Substance.</span> <span class="boldText">Logic</span> is the study of systematically evaluating arguments for <span class="italicsText">internal cogency</span>. There are numerous standards for internal cogency, but the standard we are most often concerned with in mathematics is <span class="boldText">logical validity</span>. Consider the argument synonymous with introductory logic texts:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<ul class="larg">
								<li>All men are mortal.</li>
								<li>Socrates is a man.</li>
								<li class="conc">Socrates is mortal.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>From the argument, we can ask two questions:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Are the <span class="boldText">premises</span> true?</li>
						<li>What is the <span class="italicsText">quality</span> of the <span class="boldText">inference steps</span> from the premises to the conclusion?</li>
					</ol>
					<p>These two questions evidence a distinction: Asking whether an argument starts from true premises is different from asking how the argument moves from one proposition to the next. True, we generally want our arguments to satisfy both conditions. Nevertheless, they are two separate questions requiring different knowledge. Whether premises are true is an issue of <span class="italicsText">substance</span> &mdash; the question is determined by reference to data or known facts. Thus, the issue is within the expert's domain. If the argument concerns economics, then whether the premises are true is answered by the economist. If physics, the physicist, and if mathematics, the mathematician. On the other hand, <span class="boldText">internal cogency</span> &mdash; an argument's movement, or flow, from one proposition to the next &mdash; is an issue of <span class="italicsText">form</span>. It concerns both the expert and the logician.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="deduction_vs_induction" class="grid-item">
					<p><span class="topic">Deduction v. Induction.</span> The argument in the preceding example is described as <span class="boldText">deductively valid</span>. Now consider this argument:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<ul class="larg">
								<li>My doctor has never poisoned anyone.</li>
								<li>The medicine I've been prescribed is a routine prescription.</li>
								<li class="conc">My doctor will not poison me.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Notice the difference between this argument and the preceding one. It does not share the same &#8220;air-tight&#8221; quality. There is nothing &#8220;wrong&#8221; with the argument, but it's internal cogency is different. When we extrapolate from past data to arrive at conclusions about the future, we engage in <span class="boldText">inductive reasoning</span>. Inductive arguments can have <span class="italicsText">inductively strong</span> conclusions (it his highly probable that, assuming the premises are true, the conclusion is true) or <span class="italicsText">inductively weak</span> conclusions (it is unlikely that, assuming the premises are true, the conclusion is true). Inductive reasoning is the kind of reasoning we use daily. Time management, decisions concerning our relationships with others, whether to buy something now or later, these all involve inductions. Inductive reasoning is a difficult and complex area of logic, and we can only study it meaningfully if we have a good grasp of deductive reasoning. Accordingly, we will relegate our discussion to deductive reasoning for now.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="argument_form" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Argument Form</h4>
					<p>All arguments have an <span class="boldText">argument form</span> &mdash; the sequence of <span class="italicsText">propositional forms</span>. All propositions in an argument and all propositional forms in an argument form, except for the very last, are called <span class="boldText">premises</span>. Every premise relies on either one or more <span class="boldText">assumptions</span>, propositions treated as true without further proof, and are themselves premises in an argument. Premises may be <span class="boldText">explicit</span> &mdash; stated clearly to the audience, or <span class="boldText">implicit</span> &mdash; unstated. All premises lead to a final proposition or propositional form called the <span class="boldText">conclusion</span>.</p>
					<p>Implicit premises are often the best place to find weaknesses and problems in arguments. However, before we even assess an argument's premises, we must consider the argument's <span class="boldText">validity</span>. Whether an argument is <span class="italicsText">valid</span> depends on <span class="italicsText">argument form</span>. An argument is valid if, and only if, no matter what propositions are substituted for the proposition variables in the argument's premises, if the argument's premises are <span class="italicsText">all true</span>, then the conclusion <span class="italicsText">is also true</span>. If an argument satisfies this requirement, then the argument is <span class="boldText">valid</span>; otherwise, the argument is <span class="boldText">invalid</span>.</p>
					<p>The core requirement for validity is: If the argument's premises are all true, then the argument's conclusion must follow by logical form alone. Notice what this means. It is logically impossible for a valid argument to have all true premises and a false conclusion. When an argument is valid and its premises are true, we say that the conclusion's truth is <span class="boldText">inferred</span> or <span class="boldText">deduced</span> from the truth of the premises. If a conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises being true (i.e., the premises are all true but the conclusion is false or the conclusion could be true <span class="italicsText">or</span> false), then the conclusion is not validly deduced.</p>
					<p>We can test for an argument's validity procedurally:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Identify all of the argument's assumptions.</li>
						<li>Identify all of the argument's premises.</li>
						<li>Identify the argument's conclusion.</li>
						<li>Identify all logical connectives linking each proposition (this constructs the argument's form).</li>
						<li>Construct a truth table:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Enumerate the truth values for the assumptions.</li>
							<li>Enumerate the truth values for the premises.</li>
							<li>Enumerate the truth values for the conclusion.</li>
							<li>Evaluate the truth values for the logical connectives between the propositions in (a) through (c).</li>
						</ol>
						<li>If a row in the truth table shows all of the premises are true, that row is called the <span class="boldText">critical row</span>.</li>
						<li>If there is a critical row where the conclusion is false, then it is <span class="italicsText">possible</span> for an argument of the given form to have true premises and a false conclusion, so the argument form is <span class="boldText">invalid</span>.</li>
						<li>Else, if the conclusion of <span class="underlineText">every critical row</span> is true, then the argument form is <span class="boldText">valid</span>.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>For example, consider the following argument:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<ul class="larg">
								<li>${p \implies (q \lor (\neg r))}$</li>
								<li>${q \implies (p \land r)}$</li>
								<li class="conc">${p \implies r}$</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>We can assess this argument's validity following the procedures above to construct a truth table:</p>

						<table class="truth_table">

					<p>Notice that we did not fill in some of the cells in the truth table. This is because when we use a truth table to assess validity, we are only concerned with the rows where all of the premises are true. We do not need to consider situations where the premises are false. In the truth table above, there is a critical row where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Thus, the argument above is <span class="italicsText">invalid</span>.</p>

				<section id="generalization" class="grid-item">
					<p><span class="topic">Generalization</span> Valid argument forms are called <span class="boldText">rules of inference</span>. Thus, argument forms like <span class="italicsText">modus ponens</span> and <span class="italicsText">modus tollens</span> are rules of inference.

					<ol>
						<li>The argument is valid; <span class="underlineText">and</span></li>
						<li>all of the argument's premises are true</li>
					</ol>
					<p>then we say that the argument is <span class="boldText">sound</span>. More generally, the property of <span class="italicsText">soundness</span> results when an argument satisifies the relevant standards of <span class="italicsText">form</span> and <span class="italicsText">substance</span>. Soundness is the standard for obtaining new mathematical results. Validity is the bare minimum. This is because there are three different possibilities for valid arguments:</p>

						<li>false premise(s) and a true conclusion</li>
						<li>false premise(s) and a false conclusion</li>

				<section id="contradiction" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Contradiction</h4>
					<p>The principle of <span class="boldText">contradiction</span> is a cornerstone of mathematics. It is at the very heart of the method of <span class="italicsText">proof by contradiction</span>. Suppose $p$ is a proposition we wish to deduce. We can prove that $p$ is true with the following argument form:</p>
					<div class="mproof">
						<div class="premises">
							<ul>
								<li>Suppose that $p$ is false.</li>
								<li>assumption</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>If $p$ is false, then there is a logical contradiction.</li>
								<li>the data</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>$p$ is false.</li>
								<li>the assumption</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>
								<li>&#8756; $p$ must be true.</li>
								<li>the contradiction rule</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="conclusion">
							<ul>
								<li>$p$ is true</li>
								<li>Q.E.D.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<p>The critical step in this argument is the second premise: That there is a logical contradiction if $p$ is false. For this premise to be true, $p$ being false must contradict the <span class="boldText">data</span> &mdash; what we know as facts. This rule of inference is called the <span class="boldText">contradiction rule</span>. Symbolically:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<ul class="larg">
								<li>${\neg p \implies \bot}$</li>
								<li>${\neg p}$</li>
								<li class="conc">${p}$</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>The contradiction rule can be proved with a truth table:</p>
					<figure class="table">
						<table class="truth_table">
							<thead>
								<th>${p}$</th>
								<th>${\neg p}$</th>
								<th>${\bot}$</th>
								<th>${\neg p \implies \bot}$</th>
								<th>${p}$</th>
							</thead>
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td>T</td>
									<td>F</td>
									<td>F</td>
									<td class="cell-hl">T</td>

									<td>F</td>
									<td>F</td>
									<td>F</td>
									<td></td>
								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
					</figure>
					<p><span class="boldText">Eliminating possible cases.</span> The contradiction rule also allows us to narrow down possible cases by way of a powerful rule: If an assumption leads to a contradiction, then that assumption <span class="underlineText">must be false</span>.</p>
					<p>As an example of how useful this rule is, consider the following problem presented by the logician Raymond Smullyan:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>There exists an island with two types of inhabitants:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Knights who always tell the truth; and</li>
							<li>Knaves who always lie.</li>
						</ol>
						<li>On visiting the island, you are approached by two natives, $A$ and $B$, who state:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>$A$: $B$ is a knight.</li>
							<li>$B$: $A$ and I are of opposite type.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<p>What are $A$ and $B$?</p>
					<details class="answer">
						<summary>Answer</summary>
						<p>First, we observe that there are four possibilites:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>$A$ is a knight and $B$ is a knight.</li>
							<li>$A$ is a knight and $B$ is a knave.</li>
							<li>$A$ is a knave and $B$ is a knight.</li>
							<li>$A$ is a knave and $B$ is a knave.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Next, suppose that $A$ is a knight. If $A$ is a knight, then $A$ always tells the truth. Thus, $B$ is a knight. But, if $B$ is a knight, then $B$ always tells the truth, so $A$ is a knave. This is a contradiction. Thus, $A$ cannot be a knight. $A$ must be a knave.</p>
						<p>If $A$ is a knave, then $A$ always tells lies. Thus, $B$ is not a knight. $B$ is therefore a knave. And since $B$ is a knave, $B$ always tells lies, so $A$ and $B$ are not of opposite type. Accordingly, both $A$ and $B$ are knaves.</p>

					<h3>Logic of Quantified Statements</h3>

					<p>We cannot determine this argument's validity with the previous tools we used, ${\neg,}$ ${\land,}$ ${\lor,}$ ${\implies,}$ and ${\iff.}$ Those tools are exclusive to <span class="boldText">propositional calculus</span> &mdash; the symbolic analysis of <span class="italicsText">ordinary compound statements</span>.</p>
					<p>In contrast, the argument above requires <span class="boldText">predicate calculus</span> &mdash; the symbolic analysis of <span class="italicsText">predicates</span> and <span class="italicsText">quantified statements</span>. Predicate calculus requires us to take a closer look at words like &#8220;all,&#8221; &#8220;some,&#8221; and &#8220;is,&#8221; to name a few.</p>
					<p><span class="topic">What is a predicate?</span> In everyday grammar, a <span class="italicsText">predicate</span> is the part of the sentence that gives information about the subject. For example, the sentence, &#8220;Bertrand Russell is a British philosopher.&#8221; The subject is &#8220;Bertrand Russell&#8221; and the predicate is &#8220;is a British philosopher.&#8221;</p>
					<p>In logic, we obtain predicates by isolating various parts of the sentence. From the previous example, we can isolate the sentence into several variables:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>Let ${P \coloneqq \text{"is a British philosopher"}}$</p>
							<p>Let ${Q \coloneqq \text{"is a British"}}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>The symbols $P$ and $Q$ are called <span class="boldText">predicate symbols</span>, and we can use them to generalize the example sentence. For example, the sentence &#8220;$x$ is a British philosopher&#8221; can be symbolized as ${P(x).}$ Likewise, the sentence &#8220;$x$ is a British $y$&#8221; can be symbolized as ${Q(x, y).}$ The variables $x$ and $y$ are called <span class="boldText">predicate variables</span>, which take values from specified sets. When concrete values are substituted into those variables, we obtain a <span class="boldText">sentence</span>. Otherwise, these generalized sentences, ${P(x)}$ and ${Q(x, y),}$ are called by various names: <span class="boldText">propositional functions</span>, <span class="boldText">open sentences</span>, or <span class="boldText">open formulas</span>.</p>
					<div class="rule">
						<p><span class="topic">Definition</span>. An <span class="boldItalics">open formula</span> is a sentence that contains a finite number of variables. It outputs a proposition when specific values are substituted for such variables.</p>

					<h4>Quantifiers</h4>
					<p>A <span class="boldText">quantifier</span> is a logical operator that specifies how many individuals in the domain of discourse ${\mathbb{D}}$ satisfy a propositional function. Like the logical connectives, quantifiers come in various forms: &#8220;all,&#8221; &#8220;some,&#8221; &#8220;at least one,&#8221; &#8220;none,&#8221; etc. These words all serve to answering the question: Given an open formula ${P(x),}$ for how many individuals in ${\mathbb{D}}$ is ${P(x)}$ true?

					<p>Most propositions in mathematics, however, will have domains with infinite individuals, or, if not infinite, a large enough size to render the method of exhaustion impractical.

					<p>To properly analyze statements, we must be able to quickly translate informal language to formal logic and vice versa. Below are translation methods, both for propositional and predicate calculus.</p>
					<p><span class="topic">Exclusive Disjunction</span>. The word <span class="italicsText">or</span>, by default, is inclusive. Thus, given two propositions $p$ and $q$, When we refer to the <span class="italicsText">exclusive or</span>, we mean ${(p \lor q) \land (\neg (p \land q)),}$ or ${p \oplus q}$ for short.</p>
					<p>Note that when we say ${p \oplus q,}$ we are saying that $p$ and $q$ have different truth-values. Because they have different truth values, we are denying the biconditional ${p \iff q.}$ Thus, ${(p \oplus q) \implies (\neg (p \iff q.))}$</p>

					<h3>Digital Logic Circuits</h3>
					<p>Digital circuits are an ideal medium for applying concepts in logic. In 1937, MIT graduate student Claude Shannon constructed a method for solving circuitry problems by analogizing switches to logical connectives. Shannon's idea was a milestone in human achievement &mdash; it laid the foundations for modern circuits, the very bedrock of modern digital devices. In the next sections, we apply the principles of logic through circuit analysis.</p>

Indeed, as technology progressed, circuits grew more complicated, developing a need for a more robust and comprehensive language to design and analyze circuits. <span class="boldText">Digital logic circuits</span> were invented to address that need by abstracting lower-level technical details. Part of that abstraction is doing away with words like &#8220;true&#8221; and &#8220;false&#8221; or &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off.&#8221; In lieu, the symbols <span class="monoText">0</span> and <span class="monoText">1</span> became, and continue to be, the governing symbols for representing binary values (<span class="monoText">0</span> for off/false; <span class="monoText">1</span> for on/true).

				<section id="proofs_introduction" class="grid-item">
					<h3>Mathematical Discovery</h3>
					<p>With the tools of logic we've learned thus far, we must now study how to use them. When we first encounter formal mathematics, we see numerous proofs. If we are so inclined, we might (and should) read them. Assuming the proof is well-written, seeing how its arguments flow from premise to conclusion often leaves a feeling of awe. &#8220;How on earth did they come up with this?&#8221;</p>
					<p>Proofs are as much an art as they are products of logical reasoning. Like Nerida's poems or Miyazaki's films, proofs do not result from some well-established formula. They are the products of guessing here and there, experimenting, stretching and shrinking ideas to their limits, supposing the outlandish, considering all possible cases, questioning the apparent &mdash; <span class="italicsText">creative</span>, not <span class="italicsText">mechanical</span>, endeavors.</p>
					<p>Fortunately, the fact that there is no well-established formula does not mean that there aren't common techniques. There is no formula to producing essays like David Foster Wallace's or E.B. White's, but there are common starting points and shared methods. The next sections survey different ways of discovering mathematics, and more broadly, solving problems logically.</p>
					<p>As we study the various techniques, we might ask, how do we obtain the levels of mathematical creativity like those seen in proofs and other solutions? The answer is no different from any field involving creativity &mdash; by gaining experience. Just as one becomes a better essayist by reading and writing essays, one can become better at solving mathematical problems by reading and constructing proofs, <span class="italicsText">and</span> completing those pesky problem sets.</p>
					<p>Whenever we encounter proofs in mathematical texts, they should be studied carefully and deeply. Note the patterns and strategies the author used. Note what could have been better. Whenever we answer a problem in a problem set, we should check our answers and compare our approach with others. Note the differences. If the other solution is better, note why.</p>
					<p>If we cannot determine the answer for ourselves and there is a provided solution, that solution must be studied with utmost precision. Why and how does that solution result? What is it that prevented us from finding the solution? What are the terms we do not understand?</p>
					<p>If we find that our answer is wrong, we've found a treasure chest of experience. Wrong answers and errors are far more valuable then correct answers. They indicate gaps in understanding or carelessness, and we must note them so they never repeat. All of these notes will prove valuable when we construct our own proofs or solve future problems.</p>

				<section id="understand_the_problem" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Understanding the Problem</h4>
					<p>The first step to approaching a problem is to <span class="italicsText">understand</span> the problem's statement. The goal is to ensure the problem is so clear and impressed in our minds that we can explain it to someone completely unfamiliar.</p>
					
					<p>To truly understand the problem, we must isolate the problem into its component parts. These component parts depend on what type of mathematical problem we're confronting. Generally, there are two types:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Problems of proving</li>
						<li>Problems of finding</li>
					</ol>
					<p><span class="topic">Problems of proving</span>. These are problems where we must construct an argument. For these problems, there are two parts we must isolate:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>the hypothesis; and</li>
						<li>the conclusion.</li>
					</ol>
					<p><span class="topic">Problems of finding.</span> These are problems where we must find a particular fact. The problem might ask us to solve for ${x;}$ to compute a derivative; to determine which set is a subset of which. For problems of finding, there are three parts we must isolate:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>the unknown;</li>
						<li>the data (what we know); and</li>
						<li>the conditions.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>For both problems of proving and problems of finding, we isolate the parts by asking:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What do I know from the problem's statement?</li>
						<li>What do I know from outside the problem's statement?</li>
						<li>What do I <span class="underlineText">not</span> know from the problem's statement?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Answering the questions above is absolutely critical. Fortunately, there is a way to ensure we are thorough when we answer them. Recall that mathematical statements are propositions. Because they are propositions, we have a multitude of questions we can ask:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Is the statement an <span class="monoText">AND</span> proposition?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If it is an <span class="monoText">AND</span> proposition, then there are component propositions. Consider those propositions separately.</li>
							<li>For the statement to be true, all the component propositions must be true.</li>
							<li>For the statement to be false, we just need one of the component propositions to be false.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Is the statement an <span class="monoText">OR</span> proposition?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If it is an <span class="monoText">OR</span> proposition, then are there are component propositions. Consider those propositions separately.</li>
							<li>For the statement to be true, we just need one of the component propositions to be true.</li>
							<li>For the statement to be false, we need all of the component propositions to be false.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Is the statement a conditional proposition?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If it is, is it even possible to satisfy the conditions?</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Does satisfying the condition lead to a contradiction either in the problem or elsewhere?</li>
							</ul>
							<li>The only time a conditional proposition is false is if the sufficient condition is true and the necessary condition is false.</li>
							<li>If it is a conditional, what is the statement's contrapositive?</li>
							<ul>
								<li>If the contrapositive is true, then the statement is true.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Is the inverse true?</li>
							<li>Is the converse true?</li>
							<ul>
								<li>If the converse is true and the conditional is true, then the statement is a biconditional.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						<li>What is the statement's negation?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If the statement's negation is true, then the statement is false.</li>
							<li>If the statement's negation is false, then the statement is true.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Is this statement a biconditional?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If the statement is a biconditional, then the statement has two component propositions.</li>
							<li>For the statement to be true, the component propositions must have the same truth values. Either both are false or both are true.</li>
							<li>For the statement to be false, one of the component propositions must be true while the other is false.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<p>All of the questions above will take considerable thought and careful working. We do not <span class="italicsText">need</span> to answer all of them, but working through them almost always results in a much clearer understanding of the problem. The only thing we need to do is to work very carefully.</p>
					<p>For both problems of proving and problems of finding, each part must be considered thoroughly. To do so, we ask the following questions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What does this part mean?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>We shouldn't limit ourselves to a particular area of knowledge. Look to other areas of knowledge we have &mdash; set theory, geometry, algebra, physics, chemistry, even personal experience.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>What does this part imply?</li>
						<li>What does this part assume?</li>
						<li>How does this part relate to facts I know to be true?</li>
						<li>How does this part relate to this other part?</li>
						<li>How does this part relate to the entire problem?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>There are no wrong answers at this stage. We must let the mind wander and probe every thought we come across. Needless to say, this can be a chaotic process &mdash; we must write our thoughts down.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="hunting_for_a_helpful_idea" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Hunting for Ideas</h4>
					<p>Once we understand the problem, we can begin <span class="italicsText">the hunt</span>. This is where we begin looking for possible approaches. Like hunting game, this is arguably the longest and most arduous stage. There is no single way to find these approaches, but there some starting points:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>look at the problem statement and emphasize a part;</li>
						<li>focus on a particular detail; or</li>
						<li>take each detail and arrange them in different orders, and focus on a particular order</li>
					</ul>
					<p>With your focus on a particular term or an arrangement of terms, ask the following questions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What are all the possible meanings?</li>
						<li>What does this term or arrangement mean in another area?</li>
						<li>Is there another term or arrangement similar in another area?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Other helpful starting points are the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="boldText">Make a guess.</span> For problems of finding, start with a guess, and check it against the data. For problems of proving, there are two approaches:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Assume that the conclusion is true. What would this imply? Is there a contradiction?</li>
							<li>Assume that the conclusion is false. What would this imply? Is there a contradiction?</li>
						</ul>
						<li><span class="boldText">Consider previous approaches</span>. If we've seen a similar problem before, how did we or others approach the problem?</li>
						<li><span class="boldText">Consider all possible approaches</span>. Take a particular part, detail, or set of details, and approach them from different sides. If it's a geometry problem, think of it algebraically. If it's an algebraic problem, think of it geometrically. If it's a set theory problem, think of real world sets.</li>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="boldText">Construct an analogy</span>. A helpful point here is to think of an <span class="italicsText">analogy</span>. An analogy is like similarity. Similar objects agree with each other with respect to some component, analogous objects agree with respect to <span class="italicsText">certain relations</span> between their components.</li>
							<p>With an analogy, we can discover a <span class="italicsText">simpler analogous problem</span>. Solving that problem can lead to a <span class="italicsText">conjecture</span>, a hypothesis. If we prove that the conjecture is true, we have further data to work with, and with further data, there are more possible approaches to consider. In mathematics, when we prove such conjectures, they become <span class="boldText">auxiliary theorems</span> or <span class="boldText">lemmas</span> &mdash; propositions proven so as to find a solution to the original problem.</p>
						</ul>
						<li><span class="boldText">Take details to logical extremes</span>. Take details in the problem and &#8220;stretch&#8221; or &#8220;shrink&#8221; them. If we're given some number ${n,}$ what happens when $n$ is extremely large? What happens when $n$ is extremely small?</li>
						<li><span class="boldText">Use all available data.</span> Often, the failure to find good ideas or approaches is because we haven't used every single piece of data. We should not just limit "data" to what the problem provides. Think about <span class="italicsText">definitions</span> and what given propositions imply.</li>
						<li><span class="boldText">Generalize the problem.</span> When we <span class="italicsText">generalize</span> in mathematics, we first consider a particular mathematical object, then consider the broader set containing that object. For example, suppose we have the following data:</li>
						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>${1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100}$</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
						<p>We can generalize this data to something like this:</p>
						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>${1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 10^2}$</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
						<p>Examining this generalization, we might ask if this conjecture is true:</p>
						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>${1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \ldots + n^3 = m^2}$</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
						<p>Proving the conjecture above may very well lead to not just possible approaches, but remarkable results.</p>
						<li><span class="boldText">Specify the problem.</span> In contrast to generalizing, we can <span class="italicsText">specify</span> the problem. When we specify a problem in mathematics, we take a particular set of objects or cases, and focus on just one particular object or case. Many problems involve superfluous or redundant details. When we remove those details, we often arrive at a much simpler and easier problem to solve.</li>
						<li><span class="boldText">Solve a related problem.</span> If the original problem is too difficult, try and solve a related problem with similar data. Substitute propositions or variables with simpler ones of similar form. This is unlikely to result in a solution to the original problem, but it likely will provide insight.</li>
						<li><span class="boldText">Solve an auxiliary problem.</span> An <span class="boldText">auxiliary problem</span> is a problem we consider in order to gain insight to the original problem. Unlike a related or equivalent problem, auxiliary problems are problems produced from the original problem's data. We can think of them as "component problems" &mdash; they are found by breaking the original problem into smaller pieces. For example, suppose we are asked to solve:</li>
						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>${x^4 - 13x^2 + 36 = 0}$</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
						<p>We observe that ${x^4 = (x^2)^2.}$ So, we introduce an <span class="boldText">auxiliary unknown</span>: ${y = x^2.}$ This reduces the question to:</p>
						<figure class="math-display">
							<div>
								<p>${y^2 - 13y + 36 = 0.}$</p>
							</div>
						</figure>
						<li><span class="boldText">Solve an equivalent problem.</span> Two problems are <span class="italicsText">equivalent</span> if each problem's solution involes the other's solution. Many math problems have equivalent problems that are much easier to solve.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>When we try to solve equivalent problems, we might find them leading to auxiliary problems or other equivalent problems. This is perfectly fine and routine in mathematics. Go down the rabbit hole if need be.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<p>Note that the hunt often occurs while we're attempting to understand the problem. There are so many questions we can ask during the previous stage that chances are we will stumble upon some good idea. Again, there is no mechanical formula to solving math problems.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="the_plan" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Execution</h4>
					<p>Once we have a good idea for solving the problem, the next step is to <span class="italicsText">execute</span>. The following should be performed:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Answer: How does this idea relate to the problem?</li>
						<li>Carry out all of the necessary computations or inferential steps.</li>
						<li>Verify that each step is valid.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Start from the largest steps (major premises) and work your way down the smallest steps (minor premises and implicit assumptions).</li>

					<h3>Continuous Mathematics &amp; Set Theory</h3>
					<p>Continuous mathematics relies heavily on set theory, so it is worth reviewing some key concepts before proceeding further.</p>
					<p>Suppose there exists a set $A$. If an entity or discrete mathematical object $a$ belongs to $A$, we write ${a \in A}$ (read "$a$ is an element of $A$"). If $a$ does not belong to $A$, we write ${a \notin A}$ (read "$a$ is not an element of $A$"). If the set $A$ has no elements, then it is the empty set ${\emptyset}$, and we write ${A = \emptyset.}$</p>
					<p>Sets can be alluded to verbally, in set roster notation (where all its elements are individually listed), or in set notation (where the set is described in general). For example, the following sets are all identical:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>"The set of all integers whose square is between, and includes, one and nine."</li>
						<li>${A = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : x^2 \leq 9 \}}$</li>
						<li>${B = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : \lvert x \rvert \leq 3 \}}$</li>
						<li>${C = \{ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \}}$</li>

				<section id="intervals" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Intervals</h4>
					<p>An <span class="boldText">interval</span> $I$ is a special kind of set. It is a subset of ${\mathbb{R}}$ with the property: If ${s \in I,}$ ${t \in I,}$ and ${s < x < t,}$ then ${x \in I.}$ In other words, an interval is simply a set of real numbers with two explicit members, called <span class="boldText">endpoints</span>, with the added property that every number between the two endpoints is also an element of the set. Because there are infinitely many real numbers between two different real numbers, intervals with distinct endpoints have infinitely many members.</p>
					<p>Intervals can be restricted to include or exclude its endpoints. If the interval excludes its endpoints, we say that the interval is an <span class="boldText">open interval</span>. If the interval includes its endpoints, we say that the interval is an <span class="boldText">open interval</span>.</p>
					<p>Because of the special place intervals have in continuous mathematics, they have two different forms of notation: interval notation, and set notation. The table below lists some common intervals in both interval and set notation.</p>

					<p>To graphically indicate that an interval includes its endpoints, we color in the the dot marking the endpoint. To indicate exclusion, we leave the mark unfilled.</p>
					<p class="lemma">Lemma</p>
					<p>Suppose the interval ${(a, b) \in \mathbb{R}^2,}$ and ${a < b.}$ Now suppose there is a number ${\lambda \in [0,1].}$ Since ${a < b}$, we can infer ${a - b < 0.}$ We know that ${\lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda){b} = b + \lambda{(a-b)}}$ (simplifying this expression will yield ${0 = 0}$.) Since ${a - b < 0,}$ we can solve for $b$: ${b = b + 0(a - b) \leq b + 1(a - b) = a.}$</p>
					<p>Now suppose there is a number ${x \in [a,b],}$ and that ${x = \lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda){b}.}$ Solving for ${\lambda,}$ we obtain ${\lambda = \dfrac{x - b}{b - a}.}$ Given that ${0 \leq x - b \leq b - a,}$ it is evident that ${0 \leq \lambda \leq 1.}$</p>
					<p>Thus, we can infer the following rule: Given the open interval ${(a,b) \in \mathbb{R^2}}$ and ${a < b,}$ every number of the form ${\lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda)b,}$ ${\lambda \in [0,1]}$ belongs to the interval ${[a,b].}$ Conversely, if ${x \in [a,b],}$ then we can find a ${\lambda \in [0,1]}$ such that ${x = \lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda){b}.}$</p>

				<section id="neighborhoods_of_intervals" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Neighborhoods</h4>
					<p>Suppose ${a \in \mathbb{R}.}$ The set $\mathcal{N}_a$ is a <span class="boldText">neighborhood</span> of $a$ if: There exists an open inteval $I$ centered at $a$ such that ${I \subseteq \mathcal{N}_a.}$ I.e., $\mathcal{N} _a$ is a neighborhood of $a$ if there exists a ${\delta > 0}$ such that the open interval ${(a - \delta, a + \delta) \subseteq \mathcal{N}_a.}$</p>
					<p>If $\mathcal{N}_a$ is a neighborhood of $a$, then the notation ${\mathcal{N}_a \setminus \{ a \}}$ signifies the <span class="boldText">deleted neighborhood</span> of $a$. This implies that ${\mathcal{N}_a}$ is a neighborhood of $a$ if $a$ has neighbors left and right.</p>
					<p>For example, consider the following intervals:</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/neighborhoods.svg" alt="neighborhoods" class="eighty-p" loading="lazy">
					</figure>
					<p>The first interval demarcates the neighborhood of $a$. The second interval demarcates the <span class="italicsText">sinistral neighborhood</span> of $a$. Finally, the third interval demarcates the <span class="italicsText">dextral neighborhood</span> of $a$.</p>
					<p>More formally: Let ${a \in \mathbb{R}.}$ The set ${V \subseteq \mathbb{R}}$ is a <span class="boldText">dextral neighborhood</span> (right-hand) of $a$ if there exists a ${\delta > 0}$ such that ${[a, a + \delta) \subseteq V.}$ The set ${V' \subseteq \mathbb{R}}$ is a <span class="boldText">sinistral neighborhood</span> (left-hand) of $a$ if there exists a ${\delta' > 0}$ such that ${(a - \delta', a] \subseteq V'.}$ </p>
					<p>In sum, neighborhoods are open intervals centered at a particular real number $a.$ They can be large or small. The intervals ${(-1000, 1000)}$, ${(-0.00001, 0.00001)}$, and ${(-\pi, \pi)}$ are all neighborhoods of the real number 0. Moreover, we can restrict our discussion to certain sections of the neighborhood: the sinistral (left-hand) and dextral (right-hand) neighborhoods. For example, the interval ${(-100, 0]}$ is the sinistral neighborhood of 0, and the interval ${[0, 100)$} is the dextral neighborhood of 0.</p>
					<p>A neighborhood is free to include or exclude its <span class="italicsText">reference point</span>. Thus, where ${a \in \mathbb{R},}$ the ${\delta \text{-neighborhood} }$ of $a$ is defined as ${U_{\delta}(a) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : \lvert x - a \rvert < \delta \}.}$ This particular set is simply called the neighborhood of $a$, and the variable ${U_{\delta}(a)}$ is equivalent to ${\mathcal{N}_a}$. If, however, we were to exclude the reference point $a$, then we obtain what is called a <span class="boldText">reduced neighborhood</span>&mdash;the set ${P_{\delta}(a) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < \lvert x - a \rvert < \delta \}.}$ Thus, the difference between a <span class="italicsText">neighborhood of $a$</span> and a <span class="italicsText">reduced neighborhood of $a$</span> is that the reduced neighborhood of $a$ excludes the reference point $a$, whereas the neighborhood of $a$ includes $a$.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="absolute_value" class="grid-item">
					<h3>Absolute Value</h3>
					<p>
						Let $x$ be a real number. The
						<span class="boldText">absolute value</span> of $x$ is the
						distance between $x$ and the origin. We denote the absolute value of
						$x$ with the notation: $\lvert x \rvert$
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, the numbers -8 and 8 are both 8 units from the origin.
						Thus, $\lvert 8 \rvert = 8$ and $\lvert -8 \rvert = 8$. We often use
						absolute value in equations:
					</p>
					<figure class="display-math">
						<div>
							<p>$5 - \lvert 6 - 7 \rvert = 5 - \lvert -1 \rvert$</p>
							<p>$\phantom{5 - \lvert 6 - 7 \rvert} = 5 - 1$</p>
							<p>$\phantom{5 - \lvert 6 - 7 \rvert} = 4$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Algebraically:</p>
					<figure>
						$$ \lvert x \rvert = \begin{cases} x &\text{ if } x \geq 0 \\ -x
						&\text{ if } x < 0 \end{cases} $$
					</figure>
					<p>
						For example, $\lvert -8 \rvert = -(-8) = 8$. From the definition of
						absolute value, we can make the following inferences:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>For all real numbers $x$:</li>
						<ul>
							<li><p>$\lvert x \rvert \geq 0$</p></li>
							<li>
								<p>$x \leq \lvert x \rvert$ and $-x \leq \lvert x \rvert$</p>
							</li>
							<li><p>${\lvert x \rvert}^2 = x^2$</p></li>
							<li><p>$\sqrt{x^2} = \lvert x \rvert$</p></li>
						</ul>
						<li>For all reall numbers $a$ and $b$:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									$\lvert ab \rvert = \lvert a \rvert \cdot \lvert b \rvert$
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									$\lvert \dfrac{a}{b} \rvert = \dfrac{\lvert a \rvert }{\lvert
									b \rvert }$
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									$\lvert a + b \rvert \leq \lvert a \rvert + \lvert b \rvert $
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<h4>Removing Absolute Value Symbols</h4>
					<p>
						When we encounter expressions containing absolute values, it's often
						a good idea to rewrite the expression without the absolute value
						symbols. For example, consider the expression $\lvert -2 - x^2
						\rvert$. Using our algebraic definition above, we can rewrite this
						expression:
					</p>
					<figure class="display-math">
						<div>
							<p>$\lvert -2 - x^2 \rvert = -(-2 - x^2)$</p>
							<p>$\phantom{\lvert -2 - x^2 \rvert} = 2 + x^2$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						The example above reveals useful insight. Suppose that real numbers
						are points along the real number line. Let $a$ and $b$ be real
						numbers. Because $a$ and $b$ are points along a line, the distance
						between $a$ and $b$ is $a - b$. And since the absolute value of a
						number is only concerned with the distance between a point and the
						origin, we can infer:
					</p>
					<figure class="display-math">
						<div>
							<p>
								For real numbers $a$ and $b$, the distance between $a$ and $b$
								is,
							</p>
							<p>$\lvert a - b \rvert = \lvert b - a \rvert$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>

					<h3>Expressions</h3>
					<p>
						In mathematics, an <span class="boldText">expression</span> is
						simply a string of symbols, representing a mathematical object. That
						object could be a number, a rule, a formula, a function, etc. An
						expression is essentially a "name." Thus, it is neither true nor
						false.
					</p>

					<h4>Domain of an Expression</h4>
					<p>
						All mathematical expressions have a
						<span class="boldText">domain</span> &mdash; the set of all
						values for which the expression is defined. Less formally, the
						domain of an expression is essentially the boundaries of what we're
						discussing. For example, if we were debating the costs and benefits
						of capitalism, the debate might be limited to economies that exist
						today, rather than the economies of ancient Egypt. The basic idea is
						that, outside of the domain, the expression is undefined &mdash; all
						bets are off.

						For example, the expression $3x + 4$ has a domain of $\mathbb{R}$,

					<h4>Equations</h4>
					<p>
						Mathematics has a particular interest in relationships between
						expressions. One such relationship is an
						<span class="boldText">equation</span>. An equation in
						mathematics is just a statement that says, "These two expressions
						are equivalent," or, "These two expressions are referring to the
						same thing."
					</p>
					<p>
						Once we know that two expressions are equivalent (i.e., we have an
						equation), we can draw further inferences. Needless to say,
						equations are a powerful tool in mathematics, as it is often the
						case that expressions tell us very little on their own.
					</p>

					<h5>Roots &amp; Truth Sets of Equations</h5>
					<p>
						Because expressions contain variables, an equation is true or false
						if, and only if, we substitute values into those variables. Until
						then, an equation is neither true nor false. If a value is inputted
						and the equation is true, we call that value the
						<span class="boldText">solution</span>, or
						<span class="boldText">root</span>, of the equation. The set of
						all roots to an equation is called the equation's
						<span class="boldText">truth set</span>.
					</p>

					<h5>Identities</h5>
					<p>
						If an equation's truth set is the equation's domain, we say that
						equation is an <span class="boldText">identity</span>. For
						example, the equations:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>$x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)$, and</p>
							<p>$\dfrac{4x^2}{x} = x$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						are identities. Both equations have a domain of $\mathbb{R}$, and
						substituting $x$ with any real number will render the equations
						true.
					</p>

					<h5>Conditional Equations</h5>
					<p>
						The opposite of an identity is a
						<span class="boldText">conditional equation</span>. These are
						equations that are true
						<span class="italicsText">only if</span> some condition(s) is/are
						true. For example, the following are conditional equations:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>$2x = 10$</p>
							<p>$x = x + 1$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						The equation $2x = 10$ is true only if it is true that $x = 5$. The
						equation $x = x + 1$ is true only if there is some number that
						equals one more than itself (a condition that can never be
						satisfied, so the equation can never be true).
					</p>

					<h5>Equivalent Equations</h5>
					<p>
						Equivalent expressions are represented by expressions. Equations
						themselves can be equivalent. Two equations are equivalent if, and
						only if, they have exactly the same solutions.
					</p>

					<h4>The Quadratic Formula</h4>

						The Cartesian plane consists of two perpendicular real number lines.

						reprepresent the positive real numbers, and all points below the
						origin represent the negative real numbers.

				<section id="equations_of_lines" class="grid-item">
					<h3>Equations of Lines &amp; Slope</h3>
					<p>
						At very small intervals, graphs can be viewed as lines. Lines can
						either slant or remain straight, but in both cases, the line has a
						<span class="boldText">slope</span> &mdash; a number that
						measures the line's direction. Given two points, ${(x_1, y_1)}$ and
						${(x_2, y_2)}$, the slope of the line passing through the two points
						is the number $m$:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${m = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						For example, suppose we had two points, ${(-2,-1)}$ and ${(3,5)}$.
						On the Cartesian plane, these two points appear as:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/two_points_plot.svg" alt="two point plot" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy"/>
					</figure>
					<p>The line between these two points is:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${m = \dfrac{5-1}{3-(-2)} = \dfrac{4}{5}}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Thus, the line between ${(-2,1)}$ and ${(3,5)}$ has a slope of
						${\frac{4}{5}}$. The slope equation can also be written as:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						The variable $\Delta y$ represents the change in $y$-coordinates
						(${y_2 - y_1}$), and the variable $\Delta x$ represents the change
						in $x$-coordinates (${x_2 - x_1}$).
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="slope_comparisons" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Slope Comparisons</h4>
					<p>
						The slope $m$ of a line is a real number (${m \in \mathbb{R}}$).
						Thus, $m$ can be a member of only one of three subsets:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>(1) ${m \in \mathbb{R}^-}$</p>
							<p>(2) ${m = 0}$</p>
							<p>(3) ${m \in \mathbb{R}^+}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						If $m$ is a negative real number &mdash; ${m \in \mathbb{R}^-}$
						&mdash; then the line slants downwards to the right. If $m$ is a
						positive real number &mdash; ${m \in \mathbb{R}^+}$ &mdash; then the
						line slants upwards to the right. If ${m = 0}$, then the line is a
						perfectly straight
						<span class="underlineText">horizontal</span> line.
					</p>
					<p>
						Given the Cartesian plane, one might wonder, aren't there two cases
						for straight lines: (a) a vertical straight line or (b) a horizontal
						straight line? Yes, there are indeed two cases, straight horizontal
						lines and straight vertical lines. But, the slope is not defined for
						a vertical line. If the two points share the same ordinate (the ${y
						\text{-coordinate}}$), then the line is a horizontal line (e.g.,
						${(a,b), (c,b)}$). If, however, the two points share the same
						abscissa (the ${x \text{-coordinate}}$), then the line is a vertical
						line (e.g., ${(a,b), (a,c)}$), but the slope is not defined. This is
						because calculating the slope for such a line would lead to an
						undefined result:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${m = \dfrac{b - c}{a - a} = \dfrac{b - c}{0}}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Does the magnitude, or size, of $m$ yield any inferences? Yes.
						${\lvert m \rvert }$ represents the "steepness" of the line. The
						larger ${\lvert m \rvert }$ is, the steeper the line slants (i.e.,
						tending towards a straight vertical line), and the smaller ${\lvert
						m \rvert }$ is, the less the line's steepness (i.e., tending towards
						a straight horizontal line).
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="point_slope_formula" class="grid-item">
					<h4>The Point-Slope Formula</h4>
					<p>
						The slope formula can be rearranged in another form, yielding the
						<span class="boldText">point-slope formula</span>. Given a point
						$P_1{(x_1, y_1)}$, the equation of the line passing through ${P_1}$
						is given by the equation:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Given the point-slope formula, it follows that the equation of a
						horizontal line is simply the ordinate of ${P_1}$. For example,
						suppose ${P_1 = (4, -2)}$. A horizontal line is a line where ${m =
						0}$, so it follows that the line's equation is:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${y - (-2) = 0(x - 4)}$</p>
							<p>${y = -2}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						We know that a horizontal line will always have a slope of ${m =
						0}$. For vertical lines, only the $y$-coordinate varies, and the
						$x$-coordinate remains the same. Thus, we can state more general
						rules for horizontal and vertical lines:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Given a point ${P_1(a,b)}$, the equation of a line passing
									through ${P_1}$ is ${y = b}$.
								</li>
								<li>
									Given a point ${P_2(a,b)}$, the equation of a line passing
									through ${P_2}$ is ${x = a}$.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</figure>
				</section>

				<section id="slope_intercept_formula" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Slope Intercept Formula</h4>
					<p>
						If we know that a line passes through the point ${(0,b)}$, then we
						can derive yet another equation for a line: the
						<span class="boldText">slope-intercept form</span>. Since the
						line passes through ${(0,b)}$ (i.e., the line crosses the $y$-axis),
						using the <span class="italicsText">point-slope formula</span>, we
						can conclude that ${y - b = m(x-0)}$. Simplifying and adding $b$ to
						both sides of the equation, we obtain the following rule: Given a
						line with slope $m$ and a $y$-intercept $b$, the equation of the
						line is given by the equation:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${y = mx + b}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						If we know that a point satisfies this equation, then it must be the
						case that it lies on the line with the equation. Furthermore,
						whenever we see an equation of this form, we should be immediately
						aware that the equation graphically represents a line.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="parallel_and_perpendicular_lines" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Parallel and Perpendicular Lines</h4>
					<p>
						In geometry, we can easily notice that parallel lines slant in the
						same direction (i.e., they have the same "steepness" to their
						slant):
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/parallel_lines.svg" alt="parallel lines" class="seventy-p" loading="lazy"/>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Because perpendicular lines have the same slant, in algebraic terms,
						the lines have the same slope. Thus, given line
						${\overleftrightarrow{\rm AB}}$ (where $A$ and $B$ are two arbitrary
						points on the line) with the slope $m_1$ and the line
						${\overleftrightarrow{\rm CD}}$ (where $C$ and $D$ are two arbitary
						points on the line) with the slope $m_2$, the lines
						${\overleftrightarrow{\rm AB}}$ and ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm CD}}$
						are parallel if, and only if, ${m_1 = m_2}$. In other words, two
						lines are parallel, if and only if, they have the same slope.
					</p>
					<p>
						In contrast, perpendicular lines slant in the exact opposite
						direction, forming 90º angles:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img
							src="images/perpendicular_lines.svg"
							alt="perpendicular lines"
							class="seventy-p"
							loading="lazy"
						/>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Given that two lines are perpendicular if and only if they form 90º
						angles, it follows that for a line to be parallel to another line,
						the line's slope must be the negative reciprocal of the other line.
						Thus, given a line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm EF}}$ (where $E$ and
						$F$ are arbitrary points on the line) with the slope $m_1$ and a
						line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm GH}}$ (where $G$ and $H$ are arbirary
						points on the line) with the slope $m_2$, lines
						${\overleftrightarrow{\rm EF}}$ and ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm GH}}$
						are perpendicular if, and only if, ${m_1 = - \dfrac{1}{m_2}}$.
					</p>
					<p>
						To see why a perpendicular line's slope must be the negative
						reciprocal of the other line, consider the following: First, suppose
						we have three lines, $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, and the vertical line ${x =
						1}$. Now suppose that ${\ell_1 \perp \ell_2}$, ${\ell_1}$ has a
						slope ${m_1}$, and ${\ell_2}$ has a slope ${m_2}$. Finally, suppose
						that ${\ell_1}$ and ${\ell_2}$ intersect at the origin, ${(0,0)}$.
						The lines can be visually represented as:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img
							src="images/proof_perpendicular_lines.svg"
							alt="proof perpendicular lines"
							class="seventy-p"
							loading="lazy"
						/>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Since ${\ell_1 \perp \ell_2}$, we know that that the vertical line
						${x = 1}$ intersects ${\ell_1}$ at ${(1, m_1)}$ and ${\ell_2}$ at
						${(1,m_2).}$ This is because both lines have a ${\Delta x = 1.}$
					</p>
					<p>
						Where ${\ell_1}$ and ${\ell_2}$ intersect, a right angle, ${\angle
						ABC}$, is formed, since perpendicular lines form right angles. Thus,
						it follows that there is a right triangle ${\triangle ABC,}$ since
						the resulting triangle from ${\angle ABC}$ forms a right triangle.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, consider the distance between the origin, ${B(0,0)}$, and the
						point ${A(1,m_1)}$. From the distance formula, the length of
						${\overline{\rm BA}}$ (the distance between $B$ and $A$) is
						${\overline{\rm BA} = \sqrt{1 + {m_1}^2}.}$ Similarly,
						${\overline{\rm BC} = \sqrt{1 + {m_2}^2}.}$ Thus, ${\overline{\rm
						AC} = \sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (m_1-m_2)^2} = m_1 - m_2.}$
					</p>
					<p>
						From this analysis, we now know all of the lengths of the sides of
						${\triangle ABC}$:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>${\overline{\rm BA} = \sqrt{1+{m_1}^2}}$</li>
						<li>${\overline{\rm BC} = \sqrt{1+{m_2}^2}}$</li>
						<li>${\overline{\rm AC} = m_1 - m_2}$</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Because we know the lengths for all of the sides of ${\triangle
						ABC,}$ we can express ${\triangle ABC}$ as an equation with the
						Pythagorean Theorem:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>
								${ (\sqrt{1+{m_1}^2})^2 + (\sqrt{1+{m_2}^2})^2 = (m_1 - m_2)^2
								}$
							</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						With this form, we can isolate ${m_1}$ and ${m_2}$ to separate sides
						of the equation:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${1 + {m_1}^2 + 1 + {m_2}^2 = (m_1 - m_2)^2}$</p>
							<p>
								${2 + {m_1}^2 + {m_2}^2 = {m_1}^2 - 2{m_1}{m_2} + {m_2}^2 }$
							</p>
							<p>${2 = -2{m_1}{m_2}}$</p>
							<p>${-1 = {m_1}{m_2}}$</p>
							<p>${m_1 = - \dfrac{1}{m_2}}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						The analysis above applies regardless of where the point of
						intersection is, since perpendicular lines will always form right
						triangles. Accordingly, it follows that given a line ${\ell_1}$ with
						the slope ${m_1}$ and a line ${\ell_2}$ with the slope ${m_2}$, for
						${\ell_1 \perp \ell_2}$ to be true, it must be the case that ${m_1 =
						- \dfrac{1}{m_2}}$.

					<h4>Completing the Square</h4>
					<p>
						Given the quadratic equation ${x^2 + Ax = B}$ ompleting the square
						can be summarized into a simple algorithm:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Look at the cofficient of ${x}$, $A.$</li>
						<li>Divide the coefficient by 2: ${\dfrac{A}{2}.}$</li>
						<li>Square the result: ${\left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2.}$</li>
						<li>
							Add the number from step 1 to both sides of the equation: ${x^2 -
							Ax + \left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2 = B +
							\left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)^2.}$
						</li>
						<li>Simplify the equation.</li>
						<li>Factor the result.</li>
						<li>Solve for $x.$</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						For example, suppose we were confronted by the quadratic equation:
						${x^2 - 2x = 4.}$ Applying the method of completing the square, we
						look at the coefficient of $x$ first. We see that it is -2. We
						divide this number by 2 and square it:
						${\left(\dfrac{(-2)}{2}\right)^2 = 1.}$ Then we add this number to
						both sides of the equation: ${x^2 - 2x + 1 = 4 + 1.}$ Simplifying,
						we obtain ${x^2 - 2x + 1 = 5.}$ We factor the left-hand side, and
						reach ${(x-1)(x-1) = 5,}$ or, with a square, ${(x-1)^2 = 5.}$ Taking
						the square root of both sides, we have ${x - 1 = \pm \sqrt{5}}$
						(always be mindful of the the fact that squares result from both
						positive and negative numbers). Finally, we solve for ${x}$ by
						adding 1 to both sides: ${x = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}.}$ Thus, the truth set
						of the equation ${x^2 - 2x = 4}$ is ${x \in \{ 1 + \sqrt{5}, 1 -
						\sqrt{5} \}.}$

					<h4>The Quadratic Formula</h4>
					<p>From the method of completing the square, we can derive the <span class="boldText">quadratic formula</span>, a formula that allows us to quickly deduce the truth set of a quadratic equation.</p>
					<p>To derive the formula, we begin wtih the general quadratic equation: ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a \neq 0.}$ We divide both sides by $a$, and obtain:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x + \left( \dfrac{c}{a} \right) = 0.}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Then we subtract ${\dfrac{c}{a}}$ from both sides, and obtain:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x = - \left( \dfrac{c}{a} \right).}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Now we comlete the square, by adding ${\dfrac{b^2}{4a^2}}$ to both sides:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x + \dfrac{b^2}{4a^2} = \dfrac{b^2}{4a^2} - \dfrac{c}{a}}$</p>
							<p>${\left( x + \dfrac{b}{2a} \right)^2 = \dfrac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}}$</p>
							<p>${x + \dfrac{b}{2a} = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}} = \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2 \lvert a \rvert }}$</p>
							<p>${= \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - rac}}{2a}}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Thus, the truth set of the quadratic equation ${a^2 + bx + c = 0}$ is:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${x \in \left\{-\dfrac{b}{2a} + \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \space - \dfrac{b}{2a} - \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \right\}}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>The quadratic formula will <span class="underlineText">always</span> yield the truth set for quadratic equations of the form ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0.}$ In the event that the term ${b^2 - 4ac \in \mathbb{R}^-}$ (the <span class="italicsText">discriminant</span>), however, the truth set of the equation consists of <span class="italicsText">complex numbers</span>, rather than <span class="italicsText">real numbers</span>.</p>

					<h5>The Discriminant</h5>
					<p>In the quadratic formula, the expression that appears below the radical sign, ${b^2 - 4ac,}$ is called the <span class="boldText">discriminant</span>. If the discriminant evaluates to a positive real number, then the quadratic equation has 2 real solutions. If the discriminant evaluates to 0, then the quadratic equation has only 1 real solution.

				<section id="inequalities_equations" class="grid-item">
					<h3>Inequalities</h3>
					<p>Most critical findings in mathematics result from inequalities rather than equations. And understandibly so &mdash; it is often easier to determine whether particular expressions are greater or less than others, in comparison to concluding that they are equal. Whenever we replace the equal sign in an equation with one of the symbols $<$, $\leq$, $>$, or ${\geq,}$ we obtain an <span class="boldText">inequality</span>. Both equations and inequalities are mathematical statements. As such, inequalities, like equations, have truth sets &mdash; the set of all values that render the inequality true if any member of that set is substituted into a variable, or variables, of the inequality.</p>
					<p>For example, suppose ${2x - 3 < 8.}$ The value ${x = 5}$ would be a member of the inequality's truth set, since ${2(5) - 3 = 7 < 8.}$ The value ${x = 10,}$ however, would not be a member of that truth set, since ${2(10) - 3 = 17 \nless 8.}$ We can find the entire truth set for the inequality by solving for $x$, using the same techniques for equations:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${2x - 3 < 8 = 2x - 3 + 3 < 8 + 3}$</p>
							<p>${2x < 8 + 3}$</p>
							<p>${2x < 11}$</p>
							<p>${x < \dfrac{11}{2}}$</p>
							<p>&there4; The truth set of ${2x - 3 < 8}$ is ${\left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x < \dfrac{11}{2}\right\}.}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Although inequalities can be solved by mostly applying the techniques for equations, there are some situations we should take care when handling. Particularly, we must be careful whenever we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by the same nonzero number. For example, suppose ${1 < 3.}$ If we multiplied both sides of the inequality by 10, we would obtain ${10 < 30.}$ Clearly this is true. But if were to multiply both sides by -5, we would obtain ${-5 < -15.}$ This is most certainly false. This observation returns 2 general rules:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a positive real number, then the inequality is preserved.</li>
						<li>If both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a negative real number, then the inequality is reversed.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>More explicit rules:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>If ${a < b,}$ then ${a + c < b + c,}$ and ${a - c < b - c.}$</li>
						<li>If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^+,}$ then ${ac < bc,}$ and ${\dfrac{a}{c} < \dfrac{b}{c}.}$</li>
						<li>If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^-,}$ then ${ac > bc,}$ and ${\dfrac{a}{c} > \dfrac{b}{c}.}$</li>
						<li>If ${a < b}$ and ${b < c,}$ then ${a < c.}$</li>
					</ol>

				<section id="absolute_values_and_inequalities" class="grid-item">
					<h4>Absolute Values and Inequalities</h4>
					<p>Whenever we see absolute values in inequalities, we should be on high alert. Suppose that ${a \in \mathbb{R},}$ ${u \in \mathbb{R},}$ and ${a > 0.}$ The following rules hold:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${\lvert u \rvert < a \iff -a < u < a}$</p>
							<p>${\lvert u \rvert < a \iff (u < -a \text{ or }  u > a) }$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>These rules follow from observing the number line. The statement ${-a < u < a}$ implies that $u$ is somewhere between $-a$ and $a$, which is equivalent to saying that the distance from $u$ to 0 is less than $a$ (which, in mathematical notation, is simply ${\lvert u \rvert < a }$).</p>
					<p>When inequalities contain expressions couched between absolute value symbols, the inequality is effectively expressing the expression's distance from 0. For example, suppse ${\lvert x - 3 \rvert < 1. }$ This statement tells us that the distance of ${\lvert x - 3 \rvert }$ from 0 is less than 1. Visually, this appears as:</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/inequality_absolute_value.svg" alt="absolute value inequality" class="seventy-p" loading="lazy">

					<h5>The Product &amp; Sum of the Roots of ${x^2 + bx + c = 0}$</h5>
					<p>Suppose we were faced with the equation ${x^2 = 5 - 3x.}$ What are the roots of this equation? First, let's rewrite the equation: ${x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0.}$ Then let's use the quadratic formula:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}}$</p>
							<p>${\phantom{x}  = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2-4(1)(-5)}}{2(1)}}$</p>
							<p>${\phantom{x}  = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9+20}}{2}}$</p>
							<p>${\phantom{x}  = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{29}}{2}}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Thus, the truth set of ${x^2 = 5 - 3x}$ is:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${ x \in \left\{ \dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2}, \space \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2}\right\}}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>What would happen if we multiplied the two roots?</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${\left( \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2} \right) \left( \dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2} \right) = \dfrac{(-3)^2 - (\sqrt{29})^2}{4}}$</p>
							<p>${= \dfrac{9 - 29}{4} = \dfrac{-20}{4} = -5}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>The product of the two roots is -5. What would happen if we added the two roots?</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${\dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2} + \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2} = \dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29} + (-3) - \sqrt{29}}{2}}$</p>
							<p>${= \dfrac{-6}{2} = -3}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>The sum of the two roots is -3. Recall that the quadratic equation was ${x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0.}$ Is it pure coincidence that product of the two roots is -5, the $c$ term in the equation, and the sum of the two roots, -3, is the negative of the the $b$ term? Not a coincidence at all. In fact, it follows from a more general rule.</p>
					<p>Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of the quadratic equation ${x^2 + bx + c = 0.}$ It follows that ${r_1 r_2 = c}$ and ${r_1 + r_2 = -b.}$ In other words, the product of the roots of ${x^2 + bx + c = 0}$ is the constant term in the equation, $c$, and the sum of the roots is the negative of the coefficient of the $x$ term, $b$ (i.e., $-b$).</p>
					<p>The general rule follows from manipulating the quadratic formula. Suppose there exists a quadratic equation ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a = 1.}$ From the quadratic formula, it follows that the roots of the equation are:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>

				<section id="theory_completing_the_square" class="grid-item">
					<h5>The Reasoning Behind Completing the Square</h5>
					<p>
						The method of completing the square follows from geometry. Suppose
						we had a square, ${\square ABCD}$ with sides of length ${x}$:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/square_of_length_x.svg" alt="square" class="thirty-p" loading="lazy"/>
					</figure>
					<p>
						We know that the area of ${\square ABCD}$ is ${x^2.}$ Now suppose
						that we were to add a rectangle with a width of $b$ and a length of
						$x$ to the square. This rectangle has an area of ${bx}$. When we add
						the rectangle, we obtain a total area of ${x^2 + bx:}$
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img
							src="images/rectangles_added_completing_the_square.svg"
							alt="rectangle added"
							class="fifty-p"
							loading="lazy"
						/>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Now suppose we rearranged the resulting shape by (1) splitting the
						added rectangle vertically, (2) leaving one half at the original
						square's side, and (3) moving the other half to the square's base:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img
							src="images/rearrange_completing_the_square.svg"
							alt="rearrangement"
							class="forty-p"
							loading="lazy"
						/>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Notice that a gap is left. What might be the dimensions of the shape
						that would fill that gap? Well, we know that the total area of the
						rectange we created earlier is ${x^2 + bx}$. We also know that the
						two halves we created must respectively have an area of
						${x\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right).}$ Thus, the shape we need to fill the
						gap must have an area of ${\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)^2}$, or,
						simplifying the expression, ${\dfrac{b^2}{4}.}$
					</p>
					<p>
						To see the connection to the algebraic method, consider the shape
						above without filling the gap. That shape has an area of ${x^2 +
						\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)x + \left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)x = x^2 +
						bx.}$ When we complete the square, we add the area of the "missing
						square": ${\dfrac{b^2}{4}.}$ Look familiar? Algebraically, the area
						of the incomplete shape is a quadratic equation.
					</p>
					<p>
						If we had an equation of the form ${ax^2 + bx + c}$, where $a$, $b$,
						and $c$ are constants and ${a \neq 1,}$ that tells us that our
						original square has an area of ${ax^2}$. That $a$ makes computations
						needlessly difficult, and we want our original shape to be a square
						of area ${x^2}$. Since $a$ is a constant, we can get rid of its
						place before $x$ by dividing all of the terms in the equation by
						$a:$
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${ x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x + \dfrac{c}{a} = 0.}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						We can then move the term ${\dfrac{c}{a}}$ to the right side of the
						equation, to give us our incomplete shape:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x = - \dfrac{c}{a}.}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						The term ${\dfrac{b}{a}}$ represents the side of our added
						rectangle. The side of our halved rectangles then, is
						${\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)}{2} = \dfrac{b}{2a}}$. And since
						${\dfrac{b}{2a}}$ represents the side of our halved rectangles, the
						missing square has an area of
						${\left(\dfrac{b}{2a}\right)\left(\dfrac{b}{2a}\right) =
						\dfrac{b^2}{4a},}$ the term we add to both sides of ${x^2 +
						\left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x = - \dfrac{c}{a}.}$
					</p>
					<p>
						Thus, given a quadratic equation of the form ${ax^2 + bx +c}$, where
						$a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants and ${a \neq 0}$, the truth set of
						the equation can be found with the equation:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">

							<p>
								${x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x + \dfrac{b^2}{4a} = -

					<h3>Functions</h3>
					<p>
						A function is simply a relationship, or, in formal mathematics, a <span class="italicsText">relation</span> between mathematical objects. There are many relations in mathematics (equality, inequality, congruence, proximity, etc.). Functions are just one kind of relation. Most commonly, functions are relations between numbers, where one number shares a specific relationship, defined by a rule, to exactly one number. Do not confuse this idea of "one-to-one" with "one-to-unique." A relation can still be a function even if one or more numbers are related to the same number.    
					</p>
					<p>Functions can be represented in a variety of ways. We can represent functions algebraically, using an equation or formula: ${f(x) = \ln x,}$ ${g = \sqrt{h}}$, or ${F = ma}$. We can represent functions verbally: "For every $x$, there is a $y$ such that $y$ is $x$ squared." We can represent functions with tables, where one column lists the values of $x$, and another lists their corresponding $y$ values. Finally, we can represent functions with graphs, using a coordinate system. Regardless of the way we represent them, functions all express the same idea: a relationship where one mathematical object maps to exactly one mathematical object, according to a rule.</p>
					<p>A more formal definition: Let $A$ and $B$ be nonempty sets. A <span class="boldText">function</span> from $A$ to $B$ is a <span class="italicsText">rule of correspondence</span> that assigns, or maps, to each element in $A$ <span class="underlineText">exactly one</span> element in ${B.}$</p>
					<p>Consider the following relations:</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/functions_or_not.svg" alt="relation compare" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy">

						<p>A <span class="boldText">function</span> is a special kind of relation. It is a pairing of elements in $A$ with elements in $B$, where each eleemnt in $A$ is paired with exactly one element in $B$.  Thus, a function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is a rule or relation between $A$ and $B$ that <span class="italicsText">assigns</span>, or <span class="italicsText">maps</span>, each element $a \in A$ to <span class="underlineText">one</span> element in $b \in B$.</p>

The natural domain of a function is the set of all elements for which the function is defined. Whenever we analyze or discuss a function, we set a natural domain. That natural domain acts as the boundary of our analysis.  For example, when we discuss the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, we may specify that the natural domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$. Because the natural domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$, the domain of $f$ cannot include negative real numbers, since $\sqrt{x}$ is undefined for $\mathbb{R}^{-}$. Because of this fact, we specify the domain of $f$ as:</p>

					<h4>Arrow Notation for Functions</h4>
					<p>All functions can be represented in arrow notation:</p>
					<figure><img src="images/properties_functions_mapping.svg" alt="function map" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy"></figure>
					<p>For example, the function ${f(x) = x^2}$, in arrow notation, is ${f: x \mapsto x^2,}$ and its domain and codomain are represented as ${\mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}.}$ The benefit of arrow notation is that it allows us to easily restrict a function's inputs and outputs, which in turn allows us to differentiate functions explicitly. This is a particularly useful asset when the functions share the same assignment rule:</p>
					<p>Suppose the function ${f(x) = x^3 + 3x + 4.}$ The functions below all have the same assignment rule as ${f,}$ but they are all different functions:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>${f: x \mapsto x^3 + 3x + 4;}$ ${f: \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}.}$</p>
							<p>${g: x \mapsto x^3 + 3x + 4;}$ ${g: \mathbb{R} \mapsto [0, + \infty).}$</p>
							<p>${h: x \mapsto x^3 + 3x + 4;}$ ${h:  [0, + \infty) \mapsto \mathbb{R}.}$</p>

					</figure>
					<p>The function $f$ is neither injective nor surjective, the function $b$ is injective but not surjective, the function $c$ is surjective but not injective, and the function $d$ is a bijection.</p>
					<p>Note that in the last function, the function name $i$ was used. This is generally considered poor writing in mathematics, as the letter $i$ is almost always exclusively reserved for the imaginary number $i$ (setting aside the unorthodox practices of electrical engineers using $j$).</p>

					<h4>Function Behaviors</h4>
					<p>The ways functions map elements from its domain to the elements of its image defines the function's <span class="boldText">behavior</span>. Function behaviors fall into four types:</p>

					</ol>
				</section>

				<section id="general_functions" class="grid-item">
					<p><span class="topic">General Functions</span>. A <span class="boldText">general function</span> is one that simply satisfies all of the requirements of a function without a more &mdash; each member of a set $A$ (the domain) points to exactly one member of set $B$ (the codomain). A function is classified as behaving generally if, and only if, no element in its domain points to more than one element in its codomain. In other words, a function such as ${f(x) = 11 \text{ or } 12}$ is <span class="underlineText">not</span> a function that behaves generally.</p>
					<p>However, it is perfectly permissible for a general function to have two or more elements in its domain map to the same element in its codomain ("many to one"). It is also permissible for an element in the general function's codomain to go without a corresponding element in the domain. Neither of these properties prevents a function from being classified as behaving generally. For example, the following functions are considered general functions:</p>

				<section id="injective_functions" class="grid-item">
					<p><span class="topic">Injective Functions</span>. An <span class="boldText">injective function</span> is one where each element in the function's domain maps to a exactly one and <span class="italicsText">unique</span> element in the function's codomain. In other words, the each element in the function's domain <span class="underlineText">cannot</span> point to the same element in its codomain.</p>
					<p>Like the general function, it is perfectly permissible for an element in the injective function's codomain not to have a corresponding element in the function's domain. What is never permissible is "many-to-one" (multiple elements in the domain mapping to the same element in the codomain). This is in contrast to general functions, which allow such behavior. For example, consider the functions below:</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/injective_functions.svg" alt="injective" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy">
					</figure>
					<p>The function $g$ is injective, since each element in $A$ is assigned exactly one element in $B$. The function ${f,}$ however, is <span class="underlineText">not</span> injective, since at least two elements in $C$ are assigned the same element in $D.$</p>

				<section id="surjective_functions" class="grid-item">

A <span class="boldText">surjective function</span> is one where <span class="underlineText">every</span> element in the function's codomain has <span class="italicsText">at least one</span> corresponding element in the function's domain. The fact that an element in the codomain has more than one corresponding element in the domain does not prevent a function from being surjective, but it does prevent a function from being injective. For example:</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/surjective_function.svg" alt="surjectivity" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy">
					</figure>
					<p>In the functions above, the functions $u$ and $v$ are surjective, since every element in $B$ and $D$ respectively are assigned to corresponding elements in $A$ and $C$ respectively. The function $w$ is not a surjective function, because one element in $F$ is not assigned to an element in ${E.}$</p>

				<section id="bijective_functions" class="grid-item">
					<p><span class="topic">Bijective Functions</span>. A <span class="boldText">bijective function</span> is a function that is <span class="underlineText">both</span> surjective <span class="underlineText">and</span> injective. Bijective functions can be thought of as "perfect pairings," in that every element in the domain and every element in the codomain has exactly one corresponding element in the other, and that element is unique. In other words, there is a perfect "one-to-one correspondence" between the members of the domain and the members of the codomain:</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/bijective_function.svg" alt="bijection" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy">

					<p>Because bijective functions have perfect one-to-one correspondence, they always have an inverse function.

					<h4>Implicit Functions</h4>
					<p>Recall that the equation ${x^2 + y^2 = 1}$ has the graph of a circle:</p>
					<figure><img src="images/circle_equation_graph.svg" alt="circle" loading="lazy" class="eighty-p"></figure>
					<p>We know, from the vertical line test, that the graph does not represent a function. However, <span class="italicsText">pieces</span> of the graph <span class="italicsText">do</span> represent functions:</p>
					<div class="compare">
						<img src="images/half_circle_top.svg" alt="half circle top" loading="lazy">
						<img src="images/half_circle_bottom.svg" alt="half circle bottom" loading="lazy">
					</div>
					<p>Thus, the equation of a circle has two <span class="boldText">implicit functions</span>:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							$$
								x^2 + y^2 = 1 \begin{cases}
									y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \\[1em]
									\text{ and} \\[1em]
									y = - \sqrt{1-x^2}  
								\end{cases}
							$$
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Because of this fact, we say that the equation ${x^2 + y^2 = 1}$ defines the functions ${f(x) = \pm \sqrt{1-x^2}}$ <span class="italicsText">implicitly</span>, while each of the equations ${y = \sqrt{1 - x^2}}$ and ${y = - \sqrt{1 - x^2}}$ defines a function <span class="italicsText">explicitly</span>.

					<h3>Composition of Functions</h3>
					<p>
						Functions are not required to take numbers. They can also take other
						functions. The process of passing a function as an input to another
						function is called
						<span class="boldText">function composition</span>.
					</p>
					<p>For example, consider the function:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>$f(x+h)^2 = \sqrt{(x+h)^2-3(x+h)}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						This a function composition. $f(x) = \sqrt{(x+h)^2-3(x+h)}$, and in
						the equation above, takes an input of $x + h$. Because the function
						takes an expression, we can expand and simply the function:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>$f(x) = \sqrt{(x+h)^2-3(x+h)}$</p>
							<p>$f(x+h) = \sqrt{x^2+2hx-h^2-3x-3h}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						The equation above is a portion of an important formula in
						mathematics called the
						<span class="boldText">difference quotient</span>:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>$ \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} $</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>
						The difference quotient formula gives us the relationship of the
						slope of a line. The factor $f(x)$ represents the y-coordinate, or
						output, of a point on the line. The factor $f(x+h)$ represents
						another y-coordinate, or output, of a point on the line. The divisor
						$h$ represents the distance between $x$, the input for $f(x)$, and
						$x+h$, the input for $f(x+h)$. As a visual:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img
							src="images/different_quotient.svg"
							alt="difference quotient"
							class="sixty-p"
							loading="lazy"
						/>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Suppose that $f(x) = x^2+1$. Applying the difference quotient
						formula:
					</p>
					<figure class="math-display">
						<div>
							<p>$f(x) = \dfrac{f(x + h)-f(x)}{h}$</p>
							<p>
								$\phantom{f(x)} = \dfrac{(f(x + h) = (x + h)^2 + 1) - (f(x) =
								x^2 + 1)}{h}$
							</p>
							<p>
								$\phantom{f(x)}= \dfrac{(x^2 + 2hx + h^2 + 1) - (x^2 + 1)}{h}$
							</p>
							<p>$\phantom{f(x)}= \dfrac{x^2 + 2hx + h^2 + 1 - x^2 - 1}{h}$</p>
							<p>
								$\phantom{f(x)}= \dfrac{2hx + h^2}{h} = \dfrac{2hx}{h} +
								\dfrac{h^2}{h} = 2x + h$
							</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>The graph of $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ is a parabola shifted up by 1:</p>
					<figure>
						<!-- <div id="linearAlgorithm"></div> -->
						<img src="images/difference_quotient_parabola.svg" alt="parabola" loading="lazy"/>
					</figure>
					<p>
						What this tells us is that, for $f(x) = x^2 + 1$, as $x$ gets very
						very small, the slope of $f(x)$ gets closers and closer to the line
						$g(x) = 2x$.
