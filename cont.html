		<!-- Set Theory Intro -->
			<h3>Set Theory</h3>
			<p>Continuous mathematics relies heavily on set theory, so it is worth reviewing some key concepts before proceeding further.</p>
			<p>Suppose there exists a set $A$. If an entity or discrete mathematical object $a$ belongs to $A$, we write ${a \in A}$ (read "$a$ is an element of $A$"). If $a$ does not belong to $A$, we write ${a \notin A}$ (read "$a$ is not an element of $A$"). If the set $A$ has no elements, then it is the empty set ${\emptyset}$, and we write ${A = \emptyset.}$</p>
			<p>Sets can be alluded to verbally, in set roster notation (where all its elements are individually listed), or in set notation (where the set is described in general). For example, the following sets are all identical:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"The set of all integers whose square is between, and includes, one and nine."</li>
				<li>${A = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : x^2 \leq 9 \}}$</li>
				<li>${B = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : \lvert x \rvert \leq 3 \}}$</li>
				<li>${C = \{ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \}}$</li>
			</ul>
		<!-- Set Union -->
			<p><span class="topic">Set Union.</span> Suppose there are two sets, $A$ and $B$. The <span class="term">union</span> of $A$ and $B$, denoted ${A \cup B,}$ is the set of all elements of both $A$ and $B$. Visually:</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/A_union_B.svg" alt="set union" class="forty-p" loading="lazy">
				<figcaption>${A \cup B}$</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<!-- Set Intersection -->
			<p><span class="topic">Set Intersection.</span> Given two sets $A$ and $B$, the <span class="term">intersection</span> of $A$ and $B$, denoted ${A \cap B,}$ is the set of all elements in both $A$ and $B$. Visually:</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="images/A_intersect_B.svg" alt="intersection" class="forty-p" loading="lazy">
				<figcaption>${A \cap B}$</figcaption>
			</figure>

		<!-- Set Difference -->
			<p><span class="topic">Set Difference.</span> Let $A$ and $B$ both be sets. The difference of $A$ and $B$, denoted ${A \setminus B}$ (read "$A$ set minus $B$) is the set of all elements in $A$ and not in $B.$ In other words, ${A \setminus B = \{ x : (x \in A) \land (x \notin B) \}.}$</p>

	<section id="intervals" class="grid-item">
		<!-- Intervals Intro -->
			<h3>Intervals</h3>
			<p>An <span class="term">interval</span> $I$ is a special kind of set. It is a subset of ${\mathbb{R}}$ with the property: If ${s \in I,}$ ${t \in I,}$ and ${s < x < t,}$ then ${x \in I.}$ In other words, an interval is simply a set of real numbers with two explicit members, called <span class="term">endpoints</span>, with the added property that every number between the two endpoints is also an element of the set. Because there are infinitely many real numbers between two different real numbers, intervals with distinct endpoints have infinitely many members.</p>
			<p>Intervals can be restricted to include or exclude its endpoints. If the interval excludes its endpoints, we say that the interval is an <span class="term">open interval</span>. If the interval includes its endpoints, we say that the interval is an <span class="term">open interval</span>.</p>
			<p>Because of the special place intervals have in continuous mathematics, they have two different forms of notation: interval notation, and set notation. The table below lists some common intervals in both interval and set notation.</p>

			<p>To graphically indicate that an interval includes its endpoints, we color in the the dot marking the endpoint. To indicate exclusion, we leave the mark unfilled.</p>
			<div class="rule">
				<p><span class="topic">Lemma.</span> Suppose the interval ${(a, b) \in \mathbb{R}^2,}$ and ${a < b.}$ Now suppose there is a number ${\lambda \in [0,1].}$ Since ${a < b}$, we can infer ${a - b < 0.}$ We know that ${\lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda){b} = b + \lambda{(a-b)}}$ (simplifying this expression will yield ${0 = 0}$.) Since ${a - b < 0,}$ we can solve for $b$: ${b = b + 0(a - b) \leq b + 1(a - b) = a.}$</p>
				<p>Now suppose there is a number ${x \in [a,b],}$ and that ${x = \lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda){b}.}$ Solving for ${\lambda,}$ we obtain ${\lambda = \dfrac{x - b}{b - a}.}$ Given that ${0 \leq x - b \leq b - a,}$ it is evident that ${0 \leq \lambda \leq 1.}$</p>
				<p>Thus, we can infer the following rule: Given the open interval ${(a,b) \in \mathbb{R^2}}$ and ${a < b,}$ every number of the form ${\lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda)b,}$ ${\lambda \in [0,1]}$ belongs to the interval ${[a,b].}$ Conversely, if ${x \in [a,b],}$ then we can find a ${\lambda \in [0,1]}$ such that ${x = \lambda{a} + (1 - \lambda){b}.}$</p>
			</div>

		<!-- Neighborhoods -->
			<p><span class="topic">Neighborhoods.</span> Suppose ${a \in \mathbb{R}.}$ The set $\mathcal{N}_a$ is a <span class="term">neighborhood</span> of $a$ if: There exists an open inteval $I$ centered at $a$ such that ${I \subseteq \mathcal{N}_a.}$ I.e., $\mathcal{N} _a$ is a neighborhood of $a$ if there exists a ${\delta > 0}$ such that the open interval ${(a - \delta, a + \delta) \subseteq \mathcal{N}_a.}$</p>

			<p>If $\mathcal{N}_a$ is a neighborhood of $a$, then the notation ${\mathcal{N}_a \setminus \{ a \}}$ signifies the <span class="term">deleted neighborhood</span> of $a$. This implies that ${\mathcal{N}_a}$ is a neighborhood of $a$ if $a$ has neighbors left and right.</p>

			<p>For example, consider the following intervals:</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/neighborhoods.svg" alt="neighborhoods" class="eighty-p" loading="lazy">
			</figure>

			<p>The first interval demarcates the neighborhood of $a$. The second interval demarcates the <span class="italicsText">sinistral neighborhood</span> of $a$. Finally, the third interval demarcates the <span class="italicsText">dextral neighborhood</span> of $a$.</p>

			<p>More formally: Let ${a \in \mathbb{R}.}$ The set ${V \subseteq \mathbb{R}}$ is a <span class="term">dextral neighborhood</span> (right-hand) of $a$ if there exists a ${\delta > 0}$ such that ${[a, a + \delta) \subseteq V.}$ The set ${V' \subseteq \mathbb{R}}$ is a <span class="term">sinistral neighborhood</span> (left-hand) of $a$ if there exists a ${\delta' > 0}$ such that ${(a - \delta', a] \subseteq V'.}$ </p>

			<p>In sum, neighborhoods are open intervals centered at a particular real number $a.$ They can be large or small. The intervals ${(-1000, 1000)}$, ${(-0.00001, 0.00001)}$, and ${(-\pi, \pi)}$ are all neighborhoods of the real number 0. Moreover, we can restrict our discussion to certain sections of the neighborhood: the sinistral (left-hand) and dextral (right-hand) neighborhoods. For example, the interval ${(-100, 0]}$ is the sinistral neighborhood of 0, and the interval ${[0, 100)$} is the dextral neighborhood of 0.</p>

			<p>A neighborhood is free to include or exclude its <span class="italicsText">reference point</span>. Thus, where ${a \in \mathbb{R},}$ the ${\delta \text{-neighborhood} }$ of $a$ is defined as ${U_{\delta}(a) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : \lvert x - a \rvert < \delta \}.}$ This particular set is simply called the neighborhood of $a$, and the variable ${U_{\delta}(a)}$ is equivalent to ${\mathcal{N}_a}$. If, however, we were to exclude the reference point $a$, then we obtain what is called a <span class="term">reduced neighborhood</span>&mdash;the set ${P_{\delta}(a) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 < \lvert x - a \rvert < \delta \}.}$ Thus, the difference between a <span class="italicsText">neighborhood of $a$</span> and a <span class="italicsText">reduced neighborhood of $a$</span> is that the reduced neighborhood of $a$ excludes the reference point $a$, whereas the neighborhood of $a$ includes $a$.</p>

		<!-- Basic Algebra Intro -->
			<h3>Algebra</h3>
			<p>Here, we review basic algebra skills necessary for higher level mathematics. The skills presented here are akin to elementary-level reading comprehension in mathematics, so it is absolutely critical that we have them down pat before moving any further. Before we proceed, some terminology.</p>
			<p>For addition, the following terms are available for use:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>${\text{term} + \text{term} = \text{sum}}$</li>
				<li>${\text{summand} + \text{summand} = \text{sum}}$</li>
				<li>${\text{addend} + \text{addend} = \text{sum}}$</li>
				<li>${\text{augend} + \text{addend} = \text{sum}}$</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For subtraction:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>${\text{term} - \text{term} = \text{difference}}$</li>
				<li>${\text{minuend} - \text{subtrahend} = \text{difference}}$</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For multiplication:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>${\text{factor} \times \text{factor} = \text{product}}$</li>

		<!-- Properties of Reals -->
			<h4>Properties of Real Numbers</h4>
			<p>The fundamental properties of real numbers are the rules grounding algebraic manipulation. From these properties, we can derive a wide variety of mathematical results.</p>
			
		<!-- Commutative Properties -->
			<p><span class="topic">The Commutative Properties.</span> The commutative properties allow us to ignore <span class="italicsText">order</span>.</p>

			<div class="rule">
				<p><span class="topic">Commutative Property of Addition.</span> Given ${a \in \R}$ and ${b \in \R,}$</p>
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>${a + b = b + a}$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
				<p>I.e., real numbers may be added in any <span class="italicsText">order</span> without affecting the sum.</p>
			</div>

			<p>We can see that the commutative property of addition is by adding any real numbers: ${2 + 7 = 7 + 2 = 9;}$ ${1 + 2 + 3 = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.}$ The commutative property of addition essentially allows us to move addends as needed.</p>

			<div class="rule">
				<p><span class="topic">Commutative Property of Multiplication.</span> Given ${a \in \R}$ and ${b \in \R,}$</p>

					</div>
				</figure>
				<p>I.e., real numbers may be multiplied in any <span class="italicsText">order</span> without affecting the sum.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Here too the commutative property of multiplication is apparent by multiplying any real numbers: ${4 \times 5 = 5 \times 4 = 20;}$ ${(2)(4)(3) = (4)(3)(2) = 24.}$ The commutative property of multiplication allows us to move factors as needed; a particular useful property for quick computation.</p>

			<p><span class="exh">Exercise.</span> Compute ${1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + 98 + 99 + 100.}$</p>

			<details class="answer">
				<summary>Solution</summary>
				<p>There are 100 terms in this problem. The first term can be paired and added with the last term, the second term with the second to last, the third with the third to last, etc.: ${(1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + (3 + 98) \ldots + (49 + 52) + (50 + 51).}$ Each of these pairs sums to 101. There are 50 pairs total, so the sum is: ${50 \cdot 101 = 5050.}$ This computation is attributed to the great mathematician Karl Gauss while he was a schoolboy.</p>

		<!-- Associative Properties -->
			<p><span class="topic">The Associative Properties.</span> Where the commutative properties allow us to ignore <span class="italicsText">order</span>, the associative properties allow us to ignore <span class="italicsText">grouping.</span></p>
			
			<p>The <span class="term">associative property of addition</span> allows us to group addends however way we please to arrive at the sum.</p>

			<p>We can think of the associative property as the <span class="italicsText">sweet milk-coffee property</span>. If we want sweet milk-coffee, we can add the sugar and coffee then the milk, or the coffee and the milk then the sugar:</p>

			<p>Similarly, the <span class="term">associative property of multiplication</span> allows us to place factors in whatever arrangement we would like to arrive at the product. The commutative and associated properties only apply to addition and multiplication. They <span class="underlineText">do not apply</span> to division and subtraction.</p>

		<!-- Distributive Property -->
			<p><span class="topic">The Distributive Property.</span> The <span class="term">distributive property</span> provides that the product of a factor times a sum is the sum of the factor times the addends of the sum. This property is unique in that it addresses two operations, multiplication and addition.</p>

				<p>${\phantom{1001 \cdot 20} = 20,020}$</p>

			<p>The distributive law is effectively a rule for removing parentheses. It is the governing rule of expansion. Consider the following:</p>

			<figure class="math-display">
				<div>
					<p>${(a + b)(m + n)}$</p>

			<p>Suppose ${c = (m + n).}$ Then:</p>

				</div>
			</figure>

		<!-- Identity Properties -->
			<p><span class="topic">Identity Properies.</span> The identity properties tell us that there are two unique numbers, <span class="italicsText">identities</span>, that when added or multiplied to the the original number, return the original number.</p>

			<div class="rule">
				<p><span class="topic">Identity Property of Addition.</span> Given ${a \in \R,}$ there exists a unique number called the <span class="italicsText">additive identity</span>, 0, such that:</p>

				</figure>
			</div>

			<!-- Inverse Properties -->
				<p><span class="topic">Inverse Properties.</span> The inverse properties provide that when we add a number to a special number called its <span class="italicsText">additive inverse</span>, we get back the number's additive identity (0), and if we multiply a number to a special number called its <span class="italicsText">multiplicative inverse</span>, we get back the number's multiplicative identity (1).</p>
				<div class="rule">
					<p><span class="topic">Inverse Property of Addition.</span> Given ${a \in \R,}$ there exists a unique number ${-a}$ called the <span class="italicsText">additive inverse</span>, such that:</p>

						<div>
							<p>${a + (-a) = 0.}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>For example, the additive inverse of ${-1}$ is ${1.}$ This property leads to a special characteristic of the number 0. The number 0 is the only number whose additive inverse is itself.</p>
				<div class="rule">
					<p><span class="topic">Inverse Property of Multiplication.</span> Given ${a \in \R,}$ there exists a unique number ${1/a,}$ called the <span class="italicsText">multiplicative inverse</span>, such that:</p>
					<figure class="math-display">

							<p>${a \cdot \dfrac{1}{a} = 1}$</p>
						</div>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>The multiplicative inverse is also called the <span class="italicsText">reciprocal</span>. The inverse property of multiplication allows us to conclude: ${a\left(\frac{1}{a}\right) = 1.}$ Again, this property leads to a special characteristic of the number 0. The number 0 is the only real number with no multiplicative inverse.</p>

		<p>The Cartesian plane consists of two perpendicular real number lines.  The point where the lines intersect is 0, and is called the <span class="term">origin</span>. The horizontal number line is usually called the <span class="term">$x$-axis</span>, and the vertical number line the <span class="term">$y$-axis</span>.

		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Definition.</span> Given two points, ${(x_1, y_1)}$ and ${(x_2, y_2)}$, the slope of the line passing through the two points is the number $m$:</p>

					<p>${m = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}}$</p>

		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>The variable $\Delta y$ represents the change in $y$-coordinates (${y_2 - y_1}$), and the variable $\Delta x$ represents the change in $x$-coordinates (${x_2 - x_1}$).</p>
	</section>

	<section id="slope_comparisons" class="grid-item">
		<p><span class="topic">Comparing Slope.</span> The slope $m$ of a line is a real number (${m \in \mathbb{R}}$).  Thus, $m$ can be a member of only one of three subsets:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">

				<p>(2) ${m = 0}$</p>
				<p>(3) ${m \in \mathbb{R}^+}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>If $m$ is a negative real number &mdash; ${m \in \mathbb{R}^-}$ &mdash; then the line slants downwards to the right. If $m$ is a positive real number &mdash; ${m \in \mathbb{R}^+}$ &mdash; then the line slants upwards to the right. If ${m = 0}$, then the line is a perfectly straight <span class="underlineText">horizontal</span> line.</p>
		<p>Given the Cartesian plane, one might wonder, aren't there two cases for straight lines: (a) a vertical straight line or (b) a horizontal straight line? Yes, there are indeed two cases, straight horizontal lines and straight vertical lines. But, the slope is not defined for a vertical line. If the two points share the same ordinate (the ${y \text{-coordinate}}$), then the line is a horizontal line (e.g., ${(a,b), (c,b)}$). If, however, the two points share the same abscissa (the ${x \text{-coordinate}}$), then the line is a vertical line (e.g., ${(a,b), (a,c)}$), but the slope is not defined. This is because calculating the slope for such a line would lead to an undefined result:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${m = \dfrac{b - c}{a - a} = \dfrac{b - c}{0}}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Does the magnitude, or size, of $m$ yield any inferences? Yes.  ${\lvert m \rvert }$ represents the "steepness" of the line. The larger ${\lvert m \rvert }$ is, the steeper the line slants (i.e., tending towards a straight vertical line), and the smaller ${\lvert m \rvert }$ is, the less the line's steepness (i.e., tending towards a straight horizontal line).</p>

	<section id="point_slope_formula" class="grid-item">

		<p>Because of the point-slope formula, it follows that the equation of a horizontal line is simply the ordinate of ${P_1}$. For example, suppose ${P_1 = (4, -2)}$. A horizontal line is a line where ${m = 0}$, so it follows that the line's equation is:</p>

	<section id="parallel_and_perpendicular_lines" class="grid-item">
		<p><span class="topic">Parallel and Perpendicular Lines.</span> In geometry, we can easily notice that parallel lines slant in the same direction (i.e., they have the same "steepness" to their slant):</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/parallel_lines.svg" alt="parallel lines" class="seventy-p" loading="lazy"/>
		</figure>
		<p>Because perpendicular lines have the same slant, in algebraic terms, the lines have the same slope. Thus, given line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm AB}}$ (where $A$ and $B$ are two arbitrary points on the line) with the slope $m_1$ and the line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm CD}}$ (where $C$ and $D$ are two arbitary points on the line) with the slope $m_2$, the lines ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm AB}}$ and ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm CD}}$ are parallel if, and only if, ${m_1 = m_2}$. In other words, two lines are parallel, if and only if, they have the same slope.</p>
		<p>In contrast, perpendicular lines slant in the exact opposite direction, forming 90 degree angles:</p>
		<figure><img src="images/perpendicular_lines.svg" alt="perpendicular lines" class="seventy-p" loading="lazy" /></figure>
		<p>Given that two lines are perpendicular if and only if they form 90 degree angles, it follows that for a line to be parallel to another line, the line's slope must be the negative reciprocal of the other line.  Thus, given a line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm EF}}$ (where $E$ and $F$ are arbitrary points on the line) with the slope $m_1$ and a line ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm GH}}$ (where $G$ and $H$ are arbirary points on the line) with the slope $m_2$, lines ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm EF}}$ and ${\overleftrightarrow{\rm GH}}$ are perpendicular if, and only if, ${m_1 = - \dfrac{1}{m_2}}$.</p>
		<p>To see why a perpendicular line's slope must be the negative reciprocal of the other line, consider the following: First, suppose we have three lines, $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, and the vertical line ${x = 1}$. Now suppose that ${\ell_1 \perp \ell_2}$, ${\ell_1}$ has a slope ${m_1}$, and ${\ell_2}$ has a slope ${m_2}$. Finally, suppose that ${\ell_1}$ and ${\ell_2}$ intersect at the origin, ${(0,0)}$.  The lines can be visually represented as:</p>
		<figure><img src="images/proof_perpendicular_lines.svg" alt="proof perpendicular lines" class="seventy-p" loading="lazy" /></figure>
		<p>Since ${\ell_1 \perp \ell_2}$, we know that that the vertical line ${x = 1}$ intersects ${\ell_1}$ at ${(1, m_1)}$ and ${\ell_2}$ at ${(1,m_2).}$ This is because both lines have a ${\Delta x = 1.}$</p>
		<p> Where ${\ell_1}$ and ${\ell_2}$ intersect, a right angle, ${\angle ABC}$, is formed, since perpendicular lines form right angles. Thus, it follows that there is a right triangle ${\triangle ABC,}$ since the resulting triangle from ${\angle ABC}$ forms a right triangle.</p>
		<p>Now, consider the distance between the origin, ${B(0,0)}$, and the point ${A(1,m_1)}$. From the distance formula, the length of ${\overline{\rm BA}}$ (the distance between $B$ and $A$) is ${\overline{\rm BA} = \sqrt{1 + {m_1}^2}.}$ Similarly, ${\overline{\rm BC} = \sqrt{1 + {m_2}^2}.}$ Thus, ${\overline{\rm AC} = \sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (m_1-m_2)^2} = m_1 - m_2.}$</p>
		<p>From this analysis, we now know all of the lengths of the sides of ${\triangle ABC}$:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>${\overline{\rm BA} = \sqrt{1+{m_1}^2}}$</li>
			<li>${\overline{\rm BC} = \sqrt{1+{m_2}^2}}$</li>
			<li>${\overline{\rm AC} = m_1 - m_2}$</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Because we know the lengths for all of the sides of ${\triangle ABC,}$ we can express ${\triangle ABC}$ as an equation with the Pythagorean Theorem:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${ (\sqrt{1+{m_1}^2})^2 + (\sqrt{1+{m_2}^2})^2 = (m_1 - m_2)^2 }$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>With this form, we can isolate ${m_1}$ and ${m_2}$ to separate sides of the equation:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${1 + {m_1}^2 + 1 + {m_2}^2 = (m_1 - m_2)^2}$</p>
				<p>${2 + {m_1}^2 + {m_2}^2 = {m_1}^2 - 2{m_1}{m_2} + {m_2}^2 }$</p>
				<p>${2 = -2{m_1}{m_2}}$</p>
				<p>${-1 = {m_1}{m_2}}$</p>
				<p>${m_1 = - \dfrac{1}{m_2}}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>The analysis above applies regardless of where the point of intersection is, since perpendicular lines will always form right triangles. Accordingly, it follows that given a line ${\ell_1}$ with the slope ${m_1}$ and a line ${\ell_2}$ with the slope ${m_2}$, for ${\ell_1 \perp \ell_2}$ to be true, it must be the case that ${m_1 = - \dfrac{1}{m_2}}$.</p>

We divide this number by 2 and square it: ${\left(\dfrac{(-2)}{2}\right)^2 = 1.}$ Then we add this number to both sides of the equation: ${x^2 - 2x + 1 = 4 + 1.}$ Simplifying, we obtain ${x^2 - 2x + 1 = 5.}$ We factor the left-hand side, and reach ${(x-1)(x-1) = 5,}$ or, with a square, ${(x-1)^2 = 5.}$ Taking the square root of both sides, we have ${x - 1 = \pm \sqrt{5}}$ (always be mindful of the the fact that squares result from both positive and negative numbers). Finally, we solve for ${x}$ by adding 1 to both sides: ${x = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}.}$ Thus, the truth set of the equation ${x^2 - 2x = 4}$ is ${x \in \{ 1 + \sqrt{5}, 1 - \sqrt{5} \}.}$</p>

	<section id="quadratic_formula" class="grid-item">
		<p><span class="topic">The Quadratic Formula</span> From the method of completing the square, we can derive the <span class="term">quadratic formula</span>, a formula that allows us to quickly deduce the truth set of a quadratic equation.</p>
		<p>To derive the formula, we begin wtih the general quadratic equation: ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a \neq 0.}$ We divide both sides by $a$, and obtain:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x + \left( \dfrac{c}{a} \right) = 0.}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Then we subtract ${\dfrac{c}{a}}$ from both sides, and obtain:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x = - \left( \dfrac{c}{a} \right).}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Now we comlete the square, by adding ${\dfrac{b^2}{4a^2}}$ to both sides:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${x^2 + \left( \dfrac{b}{a} \right)x + \dfrac{b^2}{4a^2} = \dfrac{b^2}{4a^2} - \dfrac{c}{a}}$</p>
				<p>${\left( x + \dfrac{b}{2a} \right)^2 = \dfrac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}}$</p>
				<p>${x + \dfrac{b}{2a} = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}} = \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2 \lvert a \rvert }}$</p>
				<p>${= \pm \dfrac{\sqrt{b^2 - rac}}{2a}}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Thus, the truth set of the quadratic equation ${a^2 + bx + c = 0}$ is:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">

		<p>The quadratic formula will <span class="underlineText">always</span> yield the truth set for quadratic equations of the form ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0.}$ In the event that the term ${b^2 - 4ac \in \mathbb{R}^-}$ (the <span class="italicsText">discriminant</span>), however, the truth set of the equation consists of <span class="italicsText">complex numbers</span>, rather than <span class="italicsText">real numbers</span>.</p>

		<h3>Inequalities</h3>
		<p>Most critical findings in mathematics result from inequalities rather than equations. And understandibly so &mdash; it is often easier to determine whether particular expressions are greater or less than others, in comparison to concluding that they are equal. Whenever we replace the equal sign in an equation with one of the symbols $<$, $\leq$, $>$, or ${\geq,}$ we obtain an <span class="term">inequality</span>. Both equations and inequalities are mathematical statements. As such, inequalities, like equations, have truth sets &mdash; the set of all values that render the inequality true if any member of that set is substituted into a variable, or variables, of the inequality.</p>
		<p>For example, suppose ${2x - 3 < 8.}$ The value ${x = 5}$ would be a member of the inequality's truth set, since ${2(5) - 3 = 7 < 8.}$ The value ${x = 10,}$ however, would not be a member of that truth set, since ${2(10) - 3 = 17 \nless 8.}$ We can find the entire truth set for the inequality by solving for $x$, using the same techniques for equations:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${2x - 3 < 8 = 2x - 3 + 3 < 8 + 3}$</p>
				<p>${2x < 8 + 3}$</p>
				<p>${2x < 11}$</p>
				<p>${x < \dfrac{11}{2}}$</p>
				<p>&there4; The truth set of ${2x - 3 < 8}$ is ${\left\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x < \dfrac{11}{2}\right\}.}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Although inequalities can be solved by mostly applying the techniques for equations, there are some situations we should take care when handling. Particularly, we must be careful whenever we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by the same nonzero number. For example, suppose ${1 < 3.}$ If we multiplied both sides of the inequality by 10, we would obtain ${10 < 30.}$ Clearly this is true. But if were to multiply both sides by -5, we would obtain ${-5 < -15.}$ This is most certainly false. This observation returns 2 general rules:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a positive real number, then the inequality is preserved.</li>
			<li>If both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a negative real number, then the inequality is reversed.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>More explicit rules:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>If ${a < b,}$ then ${a + c < b + c,}$ and ${a - c < b - c.}$</li>
			<li>If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^+,}$ then ${ac < bc,}$ and ${\dfrac{a}{c} < \dfrac{b}{c}.}$</li>
			<li>If ${a < b}$ and ${c \in \mathbb{R}^-,}$ then ${ac > bc,}$ and ${\dfrac{a}{c} > \dfrac{b}{c}.}$</li>
			<li>If ${a < b}$ and ${b < c,}$ then ${a < c.}$</li>
		</ol>

	<section id="absolute_values_and_inequalities" class="grid-item">
		<p><span class="topic">Absolute Values and Inequalities.</span> Whenever we see absolute values in inequalities, we should be on high alert. Suppose that ${a \in \mathbb{R},}$ ${u \in \mathbb{R},}$ and ${a > 0.}$ The following rules hold:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${\lvert u \rvert < a \iff -a < u < a}$</p>
				<p>${\lvert u \rvert < a \iff (u < -a \text{ or }  u > a) }$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>These rules follow from observing the number line. The statement ${-a < u < a}$ implies that $u$ is somewhere between $-a$ and $a$, which is equivalent to saying that the distance from $u$ to 0 is less than $a$ (which, in mathematical notation, is simply ${\lvert u \rvert < a }$).</p>
		<p>When inequalities contain expressions couched between absolute value symbols, the inequality is effectively expressing the expression's distance from 0. For example, suppse ${\lvert x - 3 \rvert < 1. }$ This statement tells us that the distance of ${\lvert x - 3 \rvert }$ from 0 is less than 1. Visually, this appears as:</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/inequality_absolute_value.svg" alt="absolute value inequality" class="seventy-p" loading="lazy">

	<section id="product_and_sum_of_roots_quadratics" class="grid-item">
		<p><span class="topic">The Product &amp; Sum of the Roots of ${x^2 + bx + c = 0}$</span> Suppose we were faced with the equation ${x^2 = 5 - 3x.}$ What are the roots of this equation? First, let's rewrite the equation: ${x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0.}$ Then let's use the quadratic formula:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}}$</p>
				<p>${\phantom{x}  = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2-4(1)(-5)}}{2(1)}}$</p>

				<p>${\phantom{x}  = \dfrac{-3 \pm \sqrt{29}}{2}}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Thus, the truth set of ${x^2 = 5 - 3x}$ is:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${ x \in \left\{ \dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2}, \space \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2}\right\}}$</p>

		</figure>
		<p>What would happen if we multiplied the two roots?</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${\left( \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2} \right) \left( \dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2} \right) = \dfrac{(-3)^2 - (\sqrt{29})^2}{4}}$</p>
				<p>${= \dfrac{9 - 29}{4} = \dfrac{-20}{4} = -5}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>The product of the two roots is -5. What would happen if we added the two roots?</p>
		<figure class="math-display">

				<p>${\dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29}}{2} + \dfrac{-3 - \sqrt{29}}{2} = \dfrac{-3 + \sqrt{29} + (-3) - \sqrt{29}}{2}}$</p>
				<p>${= \dfrac{-6}{2} = -3}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>The sum of the two roots is -3. Recall that the quadratic equation was ${x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0.}$ Is it pure coincidence that product of the two roots is -5, the $c$ term in the equation, and the sum of the two roots, -3, is the negative of the the $b$ term? Not a coincidence at all. In fact, it follows from a more general rule.</p>
		<p>Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of the quadratic equation ${x^2 + bx + c = 0.}$ It follows that ${r_1 r_2 = c}$ and ${r_1 + r_2 = -b.}$ In other words, the product of the roots of ${x^2 + bx + c = 0}$ is the constant term in the equation, $c$, and the sum of the roots is the negative of the coefficient of the $x$ term, $b$ (i.e., $-b$).</p>
		<p>The general rule follows from manipulating the quadratic formula. Suppose there exists a quadratic equation ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0,}$ where ${a = 1.}$ From the quadratic formula, it follows that the roots of the equation are:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>

	<section id="theory_completing_the_square" class="grid-item">
		<p><span class="topic">The Reasoning Behind Completing the Square.</span> The method of completing the square follows from geometry. Suppose we had a square, ${\square ABCD}$ with sides of length ${x}$:</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/square_of_length_x.svg" alt="square" class="thirty-p" loading="lazy"/>
		</figure>
		<p>We know that the area of ${\square ABCD}$ is ${x^2.}$ Now suppose that we were to add a rectangle with a width of $b$ and a length of $x$ to the square. This rectangle has an area of ${bx}$. When we add the rectangle, we obtain a total area of ${x^2 + bx:}$</p>
		<figure><img src="images/rectangles_added_completing_the_square.svg" alt="rectangle added" class="fifty-p" loading="lazy" /></figure>
		<p>Now suppose we rearranged the resulting shape by (1) splitting the added rectangle vertically, (2) leaving one half at the original square's side, and (3) moving the other half to the square's base:</p>
		<figure><img src="images/rearrange_completing_the_square.svg" alt="rearrangement" class="forty-p" loading="lazy" /></figure>
		<p>Notice that a gap is left. What might be the dimensions of the shape that would fill that gap? Well, we know that the total area of the rectange we created earlier is ${x^2 + bx}$. We also know that the two halves we created must respectively have an area of ${x\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right).}$ Thus, the shape we need to fill the gap must have an area of ${\left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)^2}$, or, simplifying the expression, ${\dfrac{b^2}{4}.}$</p>
		<p>To see the connection to the algebraic method, consider the shape above without filling the gap. That shape has an area of ${x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)x + \left(\dfrac{b}{2}\right)x = x^2 + bx.}$ When we complete the square, we add the area of the "missing square": ${\dfrac{b^2}{4}.}$ Look familiar? Algebraically, the area of the incomplete shape is a quadratic equation.</p>
		<p>If we had an equation of the form ${ax^2 + bx + c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants and ${a \neq 1,}$ that tells us that our original square has an area of ${ax^2}$. That $a$ makes computations needlessly difficult, and we want our original shape to be a square of area ${x^2}$. Since $a$ is a constant, we can get rid of its place before $x$ by dividing all of the terms in the equation by $a:$</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${ x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x + \dfrac{c}{a} = 0.}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>We can then move the term ${\dfrac{c}{a}}$ to the right side of the equation, to give us our incomplete shape:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x = - \dfrac{c}{a}.}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>The term ${\dfrac{b}{a}}$ represents the side of our added rectangle. The side of our halved rectangles then, is ${\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)}{2} = \dfrac{b}{2a}}$. And since ${\dfrac{b}{2a}}$ represents the side of our halved rectangles, the missing square has an area of ${\left(\dfrac{b}{2a}\right)\left(\dfrac{b}{2a}\right) = \dfrac{b^2}{4a},}$ the term we add to both sides of ${x^2 + \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)x = - \dfrac{c}{a}.}$</p>
		<p>Thus, given a quadratic equation of the form ${ax^2 + bx +c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants and ${a \neq 0}$, the truth set of the equation can be found with the equation:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">

		<h3>Functions</h3>
		<p>A function is simply a relationship, or, in formal mathematics, a <span class="italicsText">relation</span> between mathematical objects. There are many relations in mathematics (equality, inequality, congruence, proximity, etc.). Functions are just one kind of relation. Most commonly, functions are relations between numbers, where one number shares a specific relationship, defined by a rule, to exactly one number. Do not confuse this idea of "one-to-one" with "one-to-unique." A relation can still be a function even if one or more numbers are related to the same number.</p>
		<p>Functions can be represented in a variety of ways. We can represent functions algebraically, using an equation or formula: ${f(x) = \ln x,}$ ${g = \sqrt{h}}$, or ${F = ma}$. We can represent functions verbally: "For every $x$, there is a $y$ such that $y$ is $x$ squared." We can represent functions with tables, where one column lists the values of $x$, and another lists their corresponding $y$ values. Finally, we can represent functions with graphs, using a coordinate system. Regardless of the way we represent them, functions all express the same idea: a relationship where one mathematical object maps to exactly one mathematical object, according to a rule.</p>
		<p>A more formal definition: Let $A$ and $B$ be nonempty sets. A <span class="term">function</span> from $A$ to $B$ is a <span class="italicsText">rule of correspondence</span> that assigns, or maps, to each element in $A$ <span class="underlineText">exactly one</span> element in ${B.}$</p>
		<p>Consider the following relations:</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/functions_or_not.svg" alt="relation compare" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy">
		</figure>
		<p>The relation $u$ maps the elements of $A$ to the elements of ${B.}$ The relation $v$ maps the elements of $C$ to the elements of ${D.}$ And the relation $w$ maps the elements of $E$ to the elements of ${F.}$ The relation $u$ is a function, since it maps each element of $A$ to exactly one element of $B.$ The same goes for relation $v$ &mdash; each element of $C$ is mapped to exactly one element of ${D,}$ even if some elements of $C$ map to the same element of ${D.}$ The relation ${w,}$ however, is <span class="underlineText">not</span> a function, since at least one element of $E$ is mapped to more than one element of ${F.}$</p>
		<p>We often refer to the inputs of a function with the variable $x$, and the outputs of the function with the variable $y$, or $f(x)$.  The input, $x$, is also called the <span class="italicsText">independent variable</span>, and the output, $f(x)$, is called the <span class="italicsText">dependent</span> variable.</p>
		<p>A function will never give more than one output for one input. There are, of course, relationships where on number outputs more than one number. Those relationships, however, are not characterized by, or as, functions. We will explore those relationships later in due time.</p>
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Definition</span> Given two sets $A$ and $B$, the set Cartesian product $A \times B$ the set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$, where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.  A subset of $A \times B$ is called a <span class="term">relation</span>.</p>
			<p>A <span class="term">function</span> is a special kind of relation. It is a pairing of elements in $A$ with elements in $B$, where each eleemnt in $A$ is paired with exactly one element in $B$.  Thus, a function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is a rule or relation between $A$ and $B$ that <span class="italicsText">assigns</span>, or <span class="italicsText">maps</span>, each element $a \in A$ to <span class="underlineText">one</span> element in $b \in B$.</p>
			<p>If a function is a subset of $A \times B$, then $A$ is the <span class="term">domain</span> of the function, and $B$ is the <span class="term">range</span> of the function.</p>
			<p>Every function has a <span class="term">natural domain</span> (also called the <span class="italicsText">implied domain</span>). The natural domain of a function is the set of all elements for which the function is defined. Whenever we analyze or discuss a function, we set a natural domain. That natural domain acts as the boundary of our analysis.  For example, when we discuss the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, we may specify that the natural domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$. Because the natural domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{R}$, the domain of $f$ cannot include negative real numbers, since $\sqrt{x}$ is undefined for $\mathbb{R}^{-}$. Because of this fact, we specify the domain of $f$ as:</p>

			<li>a set of all <span class="italicsText">possible</span> inputs, called the function's <span class="term">natural domain</span>, denoted ${D(f),}$ e.g., the natural domain of the function ${c(d) = \sqrt{d}}$ is ${ D(c) = \mathbb{R}}$, but the domain of the function is ${dom(d) = \{ d \in \mathbb{R} \mid d \geq 0 \};}$ in set notation, given a function ${f,}$ ${dom(f) \subseteq D(f);}$</li>

		<h4>Function Behaviors</h4>
		<p>The ways functions map elements from its domain to the elements of its image defines the function's <span class="term">behavior</span>. Function behaviors fall into four types:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>general</li>
			<li>injective</li>
			<li>surjective</li>
			<li>bijective</li>
		</ol>
	</section>

	<section id="general_functions" class="grid-item">
		<p><span class="topic">General Functions</span>. A <span class="term">general function</span> is one that simply satisfies all of the requirements of a function without a more &mdash; each member of a set $A$ (the domain) points to exactly one member of set $B$ (the codomain). A function is classified as behaving generally if, and only if, no element in its domain points to more than one element in its codomain. In other words, a function such as ${f(x) = 11 \text{ or } 12}$ is <span class="underlineText">not</span> a function that behaves generally.</p>
		<p>However, it is perfectly permissible for a general function to have two or more elements in its domain map to the same element in its codomain ("many to one"). It is also permissible for an element in the general function's codomain to go without a corresponding element in the domain. Neither of these properties prevents a function from being classified as behaving generally. For example, the following functions are considered general functions:</p>

	</section>

	<section id="injective_functions" class="grid-item">
		<p><span class="topic">Injective Functions</span>. An <span class="term">injective function</span> is one where each element in the function's domain maps to a exactly one and <span class="italicsText">unique</span> element in the function's codomain. In other words, the each element in the function's domain <span class="underlineText">cannot</span> point to the same element in its codomain.</p>
		<p>Like the general function, it is perfectly permissible for an element in the injective function's codomain not to have a corresponding element in the function's domain. What is never permissible is "many-to-one" (multiple elements in the domain mapping to the same element in the codomain). This is in contrast to general functions, which allow such behavior. For example, consider the functions below:</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/injective_functions.svg" alt="injective" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy">
		</figure>
		<p>The function $g$ is injective, since each element in $A$ is assigned exactly one element in $B$. The function ${f,}$ however, is <span class="underlineText">not</span> injective, since at least two elements in $C$ are assigned the same element in $D.$</p>
	</section>

	<section id="surjective_functions" class="grid-item">
		<p><span class="topic">Surjective Functions</span>. A <span class="term">surjective function</span> is one where <span class="underlineText">every</span> element in the function's codomain has <span class="italicsText">at least one</span> corresponding element in the function's domain. The fact that an element in the codomain has more than one corresponding element in the domain does not prevent a function from being surjective, but it does prevent a function from being injective. For example:</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/surjective_function.svg" alt="surjectivity" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy">
		</figure>
		<p>In the functions above, the functions $u$ and $v$ are surjective, since every element in $B$ and $D$ respectively are assigned to corresponding elements in $A$ and $C$ respectively. The function $w$ is not a surjective function, because one element in $F$ is not assigned to an element in ${E.}$</p>
	</section>

	<section id="bijective_functions" class="grid-item">
		<p><span class="topic">Bijective Functions</span>. A <span class="term">bijective function</span> is a function that is <span class="underlineText">both</span> surjective <span class="underlineText">and</span> injective. Bijective functions can be thought of as "perfect pairings," in that every element in the domain and every element in the codomain has exactly one corresponding element in the other, and that element is unique. In other words, there is a perfect "one-to-one correspondence" between the members of the domain and the members of the codomain:</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/bijective_function.svg" alt="bijection" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy">
		</figure>
		<p>Because bijective functions have perfect one-to-one correspondence, they always have an inverse function. In other words, where a bijective function $b$ maps elements in set $A$ to elements in set $B$, there is an inverse function ${b^{-1}}$ mapping elements in set $B$ to elements in set ${A.}$</p>

			<details class="answer">
				<summary>Solution</summary>
				<p>
					The function $g(t)$ is a rational function, so we need to restrict
					its domain according to its denominator, $t^3 - 16t$. Thus:
				</p>
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>$0 = t^3 - 16t$</p>
						<p>$\phantom{0} = t(t^t - 16)$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
				<p>Then, solving for $t$:</p>
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>$t = 0$</p>
						<p>$t = 4$</p>
						<p>$t = -4$</p>
					</div>

				<p>
					The values of $t$ listed above cannot be members of the $dom(g)$.
					Hence:

				<p>The domain of $f$ cannot include $x < 0$. Thus, $5 - 4x \geq 0$.  Adding $4x$ to both sides, $5 \geq 4x$. Dividing both sides by 4, $\frac{5}{4} \geq x$. Hence, $dom(f) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \leq \frac{5}{4} \}$.</p>

		<p><span class="topic">Inequality Switches</span>. This issue is not directly related to functions, but their mistakes appear often enough when handling functions that it bears mentioning.</p>
		<p>Given an inequality containing an expression, whenever we multiply both sides by -1, the inequality sign switches directions. For example, given the expression $-3x > 2$, to solve for $x$, we need to divide both sides by -3. When we divide both sides by -3, the resulting expression is $x < -\frac{2}{3}$.</p>
		<p>Why do we switch directions? Because given two numbers, $a$ and $b$, $a < b$ if, and only if, $b-a \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$ (in other words, $b - a > 0$). We know that: </p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${b - a = -a + b = (-a) - (-b)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Hence, $a < b$ if, and only if, $(-a) - (-b) \in \mathbb{R}^+$.  $(-a)-(-b) \in \mathbb{R}^+$ if, and only if, $-a > -b$. Thus, $a < b$ if and only if, $-a > -b$.</p>

		<p>As we can see, models are not perfectly accurate. Inaccuracy is inevitable, however, because the models are likely analyzed and generated by computers.

		<h4>Transformations of Exponential Functions</h4>
		<p>We can transform exponential function graphs just as we would other functions. Suppose the exponential function ${f(x) = b^{x}.}$</p>

		<p><span class="topic">Exponential Function Vertical Shift.</span> A <span class="italicsText">vertical shift</span> occurs if ${f(x) = b^x + C,}$ where ${C}$ is a constant. If ${C \in \R^{+},}$ then ${G(f)}$ shifts <span class="underlineText">up</span> the ${y \text{-axis}}$ by ${C}$ units. If ${C \in \R^{-},}$ then ${G(f)}$ shifts <span class="underlineText">down</span> the ${y \text{-axis}}$ by ${C}$ units.</p>

		<figure><img src="images/exponential_vertical_shift.svg" alt="vert shift" loading="lazy"></figure>

		<p>Note that when we vertically shift the graph, ${f}$'s vertical asymptote changes. When ${f(x) = 2^x + 1,}$ the vertical asymptote is ${y = 1.}$ When ${f(x) = 2^x - 1,}$ the vertical asymptote is ${y = -1.}$ </p>

		<p>More broadly, if ${f(x) = 2^x + C,}$ we shift ${f(x) = 2^x}$ <span class="italicsText">up</span> the ${\text{$y$-axis}}$, we observe the following: (i) ${\text{dom}(f) = \{ x \in \R \};}$ i.e., the domain remains unchanged. (ii) When ${f}$ is shifted up by ${C,}$ the ${\text{$y$-intercept}}$ shifts up by ${C}$ units to ${(0, C).}$ Furthermore, the horizontal asymptote shifts up by ${C}$ units to ${y = C.}$ (iii) The range bcecomes ${\text{ran} = \{ f(x) \in \R \mid f(x) > C \}.}$</p>

		<p>If ${f(x) = 2^x - C,}$ we shift ${f(x) = 2^x}$ <span class="italicsText">down</span> the ${\text{$y$-axis},}$ then: (i) The ${\text{$y$-intercept}}$ shifts down ${C}$ units to ${(0, -C).}$ (ii) The asymptote shifts down ${C}$ units to ${y = -C.}$ (iii) The range becomes ${\text{ran} = \{ f(x) \in \R \mid f(x) > -C \},}$ while the domain remains unchanged, ${\{ x \in \R \}.}$</p>

		<p><span class="topic">Exponential Function Horizontal Shift.</span> A horizontal shift occurs when we add a constant ${C}$ to the parent function ${f(x) = b^x.}$ This will return a horizontal shift in the <span class="underlineText">opposite</span> direction of the sign.</p>

		<figure><img src="images/exponential_hor_shift.svg" alt="horizontal shift exp" loading="lazy" class="ninety-p"></figure>

		<p>Observations from shifting ${f(x) = 2^x}$ horizontall: (1) The domain, ${(- \infty , \infty),}$ ${\R,}$ remains unchanged. (2) The horizontal asymptote, ${y = 0,}$ remains unchanged. (3) The ${\text{$y$-intercept}}$ shifts such that: (i) When the function is shifted <span class="underlineText">left</span> 1 unit &mdash; ${f(x) = 2^{x+1}}$ &mdash; the ${\text{$y$-intercept}}$ becomes ${(0,2).}$ This is because ${f(0) = 2^{0+1} = 2^1 = 2.}$ so the initial value of the function is 2. (ii) When the function is shifted <span class="underlineText">right</span> 1 unit &mdash; ${f(x) = 2^{x-1}}$ &mdash; the ${\text{$y$-intercept}}$ becomes ${(0, 1/2).}$ Again, because ${f(0) = 2^{0-1} = 2^{-1} = 1/2.}$</p>

		<p>Before we study the logarithmic function, we ought to be familiar with the logarithm operator, ${\log.}$ Logarithms are simply another way of viewing and thinking about exponents.</p>
		<p>Suppose the question: What is the 4<sup>th</sup> power of 2? We state this question in formal mathematics as: Evaluate ${2^4.}$ The answer, of course, is 16: ${2^4 = 16.}$</p>
		<p>Now suppose the question: What power of 2 is 16? We state this question formally as: Evaluate ${\log_{2}(16).}$ The answer here is: ${\log_{2}(16) = 4.}$ More informally:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div class="rule">
				<p>Exponents: ${y = b^x \implies}$ What is the result if I multiply the number ${b}$ by itself ${x}$ times?</p>
				<p>Logarithms: ${x = \log_{b}(y) \implies}$ How many times do I multiply ${b}$ by itself to get the number ${y?}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Logarithms are simply a way of bringing exponents back to earth. With very very large exponents, we get very very large numbers. Logarithms allow us to look at those huge numbers in simpler terms. ${10^{100}}$ is a <span class="italicsText">googol</span>, the digit 1 followed by 100 zeros, or ${1{\footnotesize\text{E}}100.}$ Instead of repeatedly writing such a huge number, we can simply think of the number as 100, where ${\log_{10}(\text{googol}) = 100}$. Similarly, both ${2^4 = 16}$ and ${\log_{2}(16) = 4}$ express the same relationship between the numbers 2, 4, and 16. 2 is the base, 4 is the exponent, and 16 is the power. The only difference: Exponential form isolates the power, 16, while logarithmic form isolates the exponent, 4.</p>

		<p>Because the natural domain of the functions we are dealing with is ${\R,}$ the logarithmic function is <span class="italicsText">undefined</span> where ${b \in \R^{-}.}$ Now consider where ${b = 0.}$ If ${b = 0,}$ then we again run into difficulty:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">

				<p>${\log_{0}(x) = 10 = 0^x = 5}$</p>
				<p>${\log_{0}(x) = 100 = 0^x = 10}$</p>
				<p>${\log_{0}(x) = 1000 = 0^x = 1000}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>The problem is that 0 raised to any ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ power is 0. Once again, the logarithmic function is undefined, this time for ${b = 0.}$ Finally, consider where ${b = 1.}$ Following the same approach:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${\log_{1}(x) = 10 = 1^x = 10}$</p>
				<p>${\log_{1}(x) = 100 = 1^x = 10}$</p>
				<p>${\log_{1}(x) = 1000 = 1^x = 1000}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Like 0, 1 raised to any ${n^{\text{\scriptsize{th}}}}$ power is 1. The logarithmic function is undefined for ${b = 1.}$ For the reasons above, we can never take the logarithm of a negative number, 0, or 1. The <span class="italicsText">value</span>, of a logarithm can be negative, 1, or 0, but its <span class="italicsText">base</span>, cannot.</p>

		<p><span class="topic">Applications of Logarithms.</span> Another way of understanding the relationship between logarithms and exponentials is to revisit the exponential growth function. Exponents, as a matter of applied mathematics, return the amount of <span class="italicsText">growth</span> after time ${x}$ &mdash; the function ${g(x) = e^x.}$ On the other side, logarithms return the amount of <span class="italicsText">time</span> it takes for something to grow to ${x}$ &mdash; the function ${t(x) = \ln(x).}$ Thus, ${f(x) = e^x}$ allows us to input a value of <span class="italicsText">time</span> and obtain the <span class="italicsText">growth</span>. ${f(x) = \ln(x)}$ allows us to input a value of <span class="italicsText">growth</span> and obtain the <span class="italicsText">time it would take to grow</span>.</p>

		<p>If we think of logarithms in this manner, then the preceding discussion on the bounds of logarithmic functions is much more intuitive. ${ln(1) = 0}$ is nonsensical; it does not take any time to grow from 1 to 1, because we already are at 1.</p>

		<p>What about ${ln(-1)?}$ This too is nonsensical in the context of discrete real-world objects. If we think of ${g(x) = e^x}$ as measuring the growth of, say, a deer population, it would not make sense to have a population of -1. Accordingly, ${ln(-1) \implies \text{undefined}.}$ In other words, there is no amount of time we can wait to get a negative deer population (again, in the context of real-world objects; there is a solution involving imaginary exponentials, but we are restricting our functions to the natural domain of \R).</p>

		<p>If we pass a float (a fractional value) into the logarithmic function, then we are asking, How long does it take to grow to this fraction of the current amount? Suppose we grow continuously at 100%, then asking for, say, the time it would take to grow to 1/2 of the current amount requires reversing the time (taking the negative time):</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${\ln(1/2) = -\ln(2) = -0.693.}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>The negative value ${-0.693}$ communicates, Go back 0.693 seconds, and you will find half of the current amount. In general, flipping the fraction and taking the negative gives us the value of float inputs into the logarithm:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${\ln(1/3) = -\ln(3) = -1.09.}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p><span class="topic">Logarithmic Multiplication.</span> Suppose the current amount is 1. How long would it take to grow to 9 times the current amount?

		<figure class="math-display">

		<p>Notice that the domain and range of the logarithmic function are the domain and range of the exponential function, but switched. Recall: Given ${g(x) = b^x,}$ where ${b > 0, b \neq 1,}$ ${\text{dom}(g) = (-\infty, \infty) = \R.}$ And ${\text{ran}(g) = (0, \infty) = \R_{\geq 0}.}$</p>

		<figure><img src="images/exponential_v_log.svg" alt="exponential v log" loading="lazy" class="ninety-p"></figure>
		<p>Notice that ${G(t)}$ &mdash; the graph of the logarithmic function &mdash; has a vertical asymptote at ${x = 0.}$ This is because ${\text{dom}(t)}$ excludes 0. We must always remember this point when handling logarithmic functions. Notice further that there are two <span class="italicsText">base cases</span>: (1) If ${x = 1,}$ then ${t(x) = 0.}$ (2) If ${x = b,}$ then ${t(x) = 1.}$ These base cases correspond to two key points on the graph of a logarithmic function:</p>

		<h4>Piecewise Functions</h4>
		<p>A <span class="term">piecewise function</span> is a function with multiple sub-functions, where each sub-function applies to a different interval in the domain. We can think of a piecewise function as a function with multiple <span class="italicsText">rules of assignment</span>, where each rule applies if, and only if, a particular condition is true.</p>
		<p>Piecewise functions occur everywhere &mdash; tax brackets; mobile phone plans; health insurance rates; employee bonuses; these all involve piecewise functions. Here is a simple piecewise function:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				$$
					f(x) = \begin{cases}
						3x &\text{ if } x > 0 \\
						1 &\text{ if } x = 0 \\
						-3x &\text{ if } x < 0   
					\end{cases}
				$$
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>The function above provides: When $x$ is greater than 0, then the rule of assignment is ${f(x) = 2x.}$ When ${x}$ is 0, then the rule is ${f(x) = 1.}$ And when $x$ is less than 0, than the rule is ${f(x) = -2x.}$ Thus, suppose we're told ${x = 9.}$ Well, ${9 > 0,}$ so the first case applies. The rule is ${f(x) = 3x.}$ Thus, ${f(9) = 3(9) = 27.}$ Here is another piecewise function:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				$$
					g(x) = \begin{cases}
						x^2 &\text{ if } x < 2 \\
						1/x &\text{ if } x \geq 2 
					\end{cases}
				$$
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Suppose ${x = 3/2.}$ Then, ${3/2 < 2,}$ so the first case applies:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${f(3/2) = (3/2)^2 = 9/4}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>And if ${x = 5,}$ then ${5 > 2,}$ so the second case applies:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${f(5) = 1/(5) = 1/5}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>We can also use the words <span class="italicsText">otherwise</span>, <span class="italicsText">elsewhere</span>, and <span class="italicsText">for</span> to indicate particular cases:</p>

		<p><span class="topic">Proving $f$ is Increasing or Decreasing.</span> Consider the function ${f(x) = x^2.}$ How might we prove that ${f}$ is increasing on the interval ${[0, \infty)?}$ Our algorithms above work only if we have an <span class="term">interval</span>, or more generally, <span class="term">bounded sets</span> &mdash; intervals with specified endpoints, or finite intervals. Here, we have an <span class="term">unbounded set</span>. In this case, a <span class="term">right-open</span> interval (an interval with no maximum). The same limitation would apply if we had a <span class="term">left-open</span> interval (an interval with no mimimum). In this situation, we need to more carefully think about what it means to be increasing or decreasing.</p>
		<p>First, understand the problem. We're trying to prove that the function ${f(x) = x^2}$ is increasing on the interval ${[0, \infty).}$ Because there is no maximum for this interval, what we are really being asked to prove is:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${f(x) = x^2}$ is increasing for ${0 \leq a < b.}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>To prove this, we must show the following statement is always true for ${0 \leq a < b:}$</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${f(a) < f(b)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Accordingly, we must prove that this is true:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${0 \leq f(a) < f(b)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>This statement consists of several component propositions:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${0 = f(a) < f(b) \equiv 0 < f(b)}$</p>
				<p>${0 < f(a) < f(b)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>In both these statements, ${f(a) < f(b).}$ Thus, the two component propositions imply that:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${0 < f(b) - f(a)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>With this restatement of the problem, we can infer:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${0 < f(b) - f(a) = b^2 - a^2}$</p>
				<p>${\phantom{0 < f(b) - f(a)} = (b + a) (b - a)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>Now, we know that ${0 \leq a < b}$ implies that ${0 < b + a,}$ and ${0 < b - a.}$ Thus, it follows that ${(b + a)(b - a)}$ can never be less than or equal to 0. Accordingly, ${0 < (b + a)(b - a)}$ is true. Hence, the function ${f(x) = x^2}$ is increasing on the half-open interval ${[0, \infty.)}$</p>
		<p>Now, how might we prove that ${f(x) = x^2}$ is <span class="italicsText">decreasing</span> for the interval ${(- \infty, 0]?}$</p>

	<section id="average_rate_of_change" class="grid-item">
		<h4>Average Rate of Change</h4>
		<p>Consider the function ${f}$ below:</p>
		<figure><img src="images/rate_of_change.svg" alt="rate of change" loading="lazy"></figure>
		<p>Along the interval ${[b, a],}$ the function ${f}$ is said to be <span class="italicsText">changing</span>. There are many ways of describing that change, one of which is the <span class="term">average rate of change</span> &mdash; the slope of the line joining the points ${(a, f(a))}$ and ${(b, f(b)).}$ This slope is defined by the open expression:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta y} = \dfrac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>The average rate of change is a measure of how much the function changes, on average, with each successive element in its domain over a given interval. Note that a positive rate of change does not imply the function is increasing. Consider the function above. The average rate of change there is clearly positive (the slope of the line between the two points, ${(a, f(a))}$ and ${(b, f(b)),}$ is positive. However, we can see that ${G(f)}$ is increasing for only part of the interval.</p>
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Definition.</span> Given a function ${f}$ and an interval ${a \leq x \leq b,}$ the average rate of change of ${f}$ is given by the expression:</p>

			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>It follows then that if we had an interval ${[a, x],}$ the average rate of change is provided by:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>${\dfrac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}}$</p>

		<p>Thus, if the interval is ${[x, x + h],}$ the average rate of change is:</p>

				<p>${\dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{(x + h) - x} = \dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}}$</p>

		<h4>Graph Transformations</h4>
		<p>Graphs of functions serve as a bridge between geometry and algebra.

All of these defines are broadly referred to as <span class="term">transformations</span> &mdash; if we reflect, translate, or scale a function's graph, we are <span class="italicsText">transforming</span> the function's graph.</p>

		<figure><img src="images/vertical_translation.svg" alt="vertical translation" loading="lazy" class="ninety-p"></figure>
		<p>Observe that when add a positive constant to the function's expression, we shift the graph up the ${\text{$y$-axis}.}$ And when we add a negative constant (i.e., subtraction) to the function's expression, we shift the grown down the ${\text{$y$-axis}.}$ This logically follows from the fact that we are essentially adding a constant value to each element in the function's <span class="italicsText">range</span>. In other words, for every output, add or substract some constant &mdash; shift the graph up or down respectively.</p>
		<div class="rule">
			<p><span class="topic">Definition.</span> Let ${f(x)}$ be a function and ${c}$ a constant, where ${c \in \R.}$ Suppose ${y = f(x).}$ Substituting ${y}$ with ${y - c},$ we obtain ${y - c = f(x),}$ which is equivalent to ${y = f(x) + c.}$ This is a <span class="italicsText">vertical translation</span> of ${f(x).}$</p>

Horizontal translations, however, are a common source of error.</p>
		<p>Consider again the graph of ${y = x^2.}$ To shift the graph to the right, we add some negative constant ${c}$ to every input. Thus, ${y = (x - c)^2}$ indicates a shift ${c}$ units to the right along the ${\text{$x$-axis}.}$ Why is it a shift right? Because to get back to the original function ${y}$, we have to add ${c}$ units. It is the same logic behind why scrolling down with a mouse wheel moves this page up, or why a gear moving clockwise turns a second gear counter-clockwise. For example, given ${y = x^2,}$ the parabola's vertex is ${(0,0).}$ However, given ${y = (x-1)^2,}$ the parabola's vertex is now ${(1,0);}$ a shift to the right.</p>

		<h3>Composition of Functions</h3>
		<p>Functions are not required to take numbers. They can also take other functions. The process of passing a function as an input to another function is called <span class="term">function composition</span>.</p>
		<p>For example, consider the function:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>$f(x+h)^2 = \sqrt{(x+h)^2-3(x+h)}$</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>This a function composition. $f(x) = \sqrt{(x+h)^2-3(x+h)}$, and in the equation above, takes an input of $x + h$. Because the function takes an expression, we can expand and simply the function:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>$f(x) = \sqrt{(x+h)^2-3(x+h)}$</p>
				<p>$f(x+h) = \sqrt{x^2+2hx-h^2-3x-3h}$</p>
			</div>

		<p>The equation above is a portion of an important formula in mathematics called the <span class="term">difference quotient</span>:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div>
				<p>$ \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} $</p>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>The difference quotient formula gives us the relationship of the slope of a line. The factor $f(x)$ represents the y-coordinate, or output, of a point on the line. The factor $f(x+h)$ represents another y-coordinate, or output, of a point on the line. The divisor $h$ represents the distance between $x$, the input for $f(x)$, and $x+h$, the input for $f(x+h)$. As a visual:</p>
		<figure><img src="images/different_quotient.svg" alt="difference quotient" class="sixty-p" loading="lazy" /></figure>

		<h3>Trigonometric Functions</h3>
		<p>Numerous processes are best described as iterating over regular intervals. The tides, progression from day to night, business cycles, these are all <span class="term">cyclical processes</span>.</p>
		<p>In mathematics, the <span class="term">periodic functions</span> is the family of functions whose members repeat their values in regular intervals. The graph of a periodic function takes the general form of a pattern that keeps repeating. Because of this repetition, the functin's graph has the same output at exactly the same place in every cycle.</p>
		<p>Because of the property of repetition, all the cycles of a periodic function have exactly the same length. This means all periodic functions have a helpful base case: The first cycle. If we know all the details of one full cycle of a periodic function, then we know all of the function's past and future outputs.</p>
		<p>To begin understanding these functions, we first turn to a subset of the periodic functions &mdash; the trigonometric functions.</p>

		<h4>Angles</h4>
		<p>A <span class="term">ray</span> is one point on a line and all points extending in one direction from that point. If we have two rays sharing a single point from which they extend, then we have an <span class="term">angle</span>. This shared endpoint is called the angle's <span class="term">vertex</span>. The two rays are called the angle's <span class="term">sides</span>. For example, consider the angle below:</p>

		<figure><img src="images/angleABC.svg" alt="angle" loading="lazy" class="sixty-p"></figure>

		<p>We denote the angle above with the symbol ${\angle ABC.}$ The individual sides of ${\angle ABC}$ are referenced by referring to the rays themselves, ${\overrightarrow{\rm BA}}$ and ${\overrightarrow{\rm BC.}}$</p>

		<p>The creation of an angle is a dynamic procedure. First, the initial position &mdash; two rays lying on top of each other. We can refer to this first step as the base case of angle creation; an angle of ${0^\circ.}$ One of the two rays lies fixed, the other is free to move. The fixed ray is called the angle's <span class="term">initial side</span>, and the free ray is called the angle's <span class="term">terminal side</span>.</p>

		<p>To identify the different sides, we draw a small arc and arrow close to the vertex, indicating the direction and distance the terminal side moves:</p>

		<figure><img src="images/angle_measure.svg" alt="measure" loading="lazy" class="fifty-p"></figure>

		<p>The angle's <span class="term">measure</span> is the amount of rotation from the initial side to the terminal side. This amount is contextualized with a unit of measurement. The two common units for measuring angles are <span class="term">degrees</span>, and <span class="term">radians</span>.</p>

		
		<p><span class="topic">Geometry v. Trigonometry.</span> A triangle ${\triangle ABC}$ has sides of length 8, 8, and 8. What are the measures of its angles?</p>
		<details class="answer">
			<summary>Solution</summary>
			<p>Because ${\triangle ABC}$ has three equal sides, its three angles are also equal. Since the sum of the angles is ${180^\circ,}$ each angle has a measure of ${180^\circ / 3 = 60^\circ.}$</p>
		</details>

			<p>Geometry allows us to complete the simple problem above. But suppose ${\triangle DEF}$ has sides 5, 6, and 7. What are the measures of ${\triangle DEF's}$ angles? What about ${\triangle GHI,}$ where ${\overrightarrow{\rm HG}}$ has a length of 3, ${\overrightarrow{\rm HI}}$ has a length of 4, and the angle between them is ${90^\circ.}$ What are measures of its other angles? These sorts of questions cannot be answered with simple geometry. Instead, what we need is trigonometry.</p>

	<section id="radians_v_degrees">
		<p><span class="topic">Radians v. Degrees.</span> A unit <span class="italicsText">degree</span> is a ratio. More specifically, ${{1}^\circ = 1/360.}$ The constant ${{360}^\circ}$ constants a full circular rotation. Why 360? Purely arbitrary. It so happens that 360 divides nicely, and works well with time measures (i.e., 60 seconds to a minute; 60 seconds to an hour; in ancient calendars, there were 360 days in a year; and the ancient Babylonians had a base-60 number system &mdash; in essence, more than likely a cultural artifact).</p>
		
		<p>Under the degree unit, a circle is defined to have ${{360}^\circ.}$ Thus, a perfect horizontal angle (a <span class="term">straight angle</span>) has a measure of ${{180}^\circ.}$ A <span class="term">right angle</span> has a measure of ${{90}^\circ.}$ An angle with a measure less than ${{90}^\circ}$ is called an <span class="term">acute angle</span>, and an angle with a measure greater than ${{90}^\circ}$ is an <span class="term">obtuse angle</span>.</p>

		<p>If we measure an angle counterclockwise from the initial side, the angle is called a <span class="term">positive angle</span>, and has a positive number measure. Inversely, if we measure an angle clockwise from the initial side, the angle is called a <span class="term">negative angle</span>, and has a negative number measure. Angles whose terminal side lies on an axis &mdash; those with measures ${{0}^\circ,}$ ${{90}^\circ,}$ ${{270}^\circ,}$ and ${{360}^\circ}$ &mdash; are called <span class="term">quadrantal angles</span>.</p>

		<p>Degrees are what most non-mathematicians are familiar with, and is the unit we most often encounter at a hardware store. Degrees, however, are not an ideal unit when handling trigonometric functions and equations in higher-level mathematics. Instead, <span class="italicsText">radians</span> are what mathematicians most often use. This is because when degrees are used as units in calculus and other more complex fields, they almost always end up being converted to radians, then back to degrees. This is an unnecessary computation since we could have just started with radians in the first place.</p>

		<p>So what are radians? First, suppose we have a circle with a radius of length ${r:}$</p>

		<figure><img src="images/circle_radius_r.svg" alt="circle r" loading="lazy" class="forty-p"></figure>
		
		<p>Now suppose there is an angle on the circle:</p>

		<figure><img src="images/circle_r_subtends.svg" alt="circle r subtends" loading="lazy" class="forty-p"></figure>

		<p>On the circle, there is an arc, indicated in red, that <span class="term">subtends</span> the ${\theta,}$ meaning the path along the circle that intersects the two sides of the angles. Suppose that ${theta}$ is the exact right size such that the length of the arc is ${r,}$ the radius. Because the arc is equal to the radius of the circle, let's just say that ${\theta = 1 \text{ radian}.}$ This is exactly how the unit radians is defined.</p>

		<p>Now, what might be the measure of this angle:</p>

		<figure><img src="images/circle_r_full.svg" alt="full subtend" loading="lazy" class="forty-p"></figure>

		<p>Well, the arc that subtends the angle ${\theta}$ is the entire circle. This means the length of that arc is the <span class="italicsText">circumference</span> of the circle. And the circumference of this circle is ${2 \pi r,}$ where ${r}$ is the radius. Hence, the measure of the angle ${\theta}$ is ${2 \pi \text{ radians}.}$ </p>

		<p>Given these facts, it should now be clear why radians are the preferred unit for measuring angles. They are <span class="underlineText">purely</span> mathematical:</p>

		<figure><img src="images/circle_radians.svg" alt="circle full" loading="lazy" class="fifty-p"></figure>

		<p>Radians can be easily converted to degrees. From the diagram above, we know that ${2 \pi \text{ rad} = {360}^\circ,}$ ${\dfrac{\pi}{2} \text{ rad} = {90}^\circ,}$ ${\dfrac{\pi}{4} \text{ rad} = {45}^\circ,}$ etc. Because a radian is simply a ratio of two lengths (the radius and the arc,) we need not include the unit &#8220;rad.&#8221; When it is included, it is simply used to indicate an angle measurement. Accordingly, we can simply write ${2 \pi,}$ ${\dfrac{\pi}{4},}$ and so on. The variable ${r}$ is actually a constant, since all angle measures using radians can be expressed as the measure of an angle on the <span class="term">unit circle</span>, a circle with radius of length 1. Accordingly, we can simply omit the constant ${r}$ when using radians. It is precisely because of this property that mathematicians prefer the radius &mdash; computations and algebraic manipulations are much, much cleaner.</p>

	<section id="coterminal_angles">
		<p><span class="topic">Coterminal Angles.</span> Recall that negative angles are angles measured clockwise from the terminal side. While negative angles are sometimes necessary, they can be awkward to work with, and it is often best to use the corresponding <span class="term">coterminal angle</span> whenever possible. Given an angles ${\angle BAC,}$ and ${\angle CAD,}$ both angles are coterminal if and only if both ${\angle BAC}$ and ${\angle CAD}$ share the same side.</p>
		<figure><img src="images/coterminal_angles.svg" alt="coterminal angles" class="fifty-p" loading="lazy"></figure>
		<p>From the diagram above, an angle measure of ${\pi / 2,}$ ${{90}^\circ,}$ is coterminal with an angle of measure ${3 \pi / 2,}$ or ${{270}^\circ.}$ When thinking about coterminal angles, we must consider the <span class="term">reference angle</span>. The reference angle is the measure of the smallest, positive, acute angle ${\theta}$ formed by the terminal side of the angle ${\theta}$ and the horizontal axis. From this definition, a positive reference angle has a terminal side in the first quadrant. A helpful algorithm for finding the coterminal angle of an angle whose measure is greater than ${{360}^\circ}$:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div class="rule">
				<p><span class="topic">Algorithm.</span> Given an angle measure ${m \angle \theta}$ greater than ${{360}^\circ,}$ to find the coterminal angle between ${{0}^\circ}$ and ${{360}^\circ:}$</p>

					<li>If the result is greater than ${{360}^\circ,}$ subtract ${{360}^\circ}$ again until the result is between ${{0}^\circ}$ and ${{360}^\circ.}$</li>
					<li>The rsulting angle is coterminal with the original angle.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
		</figure>
		<p>The same algorithm can be narrowed to finding the coterminal angle of an angle whose measure is less than ${{0}^\circ:}$</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div class="rule">
				<p><span class="topic">Algorithm.</span> Given an angle measure ${m \angle \phi}$ less than ${{0}^\circ,}$ to find the coterminal angle between ${{0}^\circ}$ and ${{360}^\circ,}$</p>

					<li>If the result is still less than ${{0}^\circ,}$ add ${{360}^\circ}$ until the result is between ${{0}^\circ}$ and ${{360}^\circ.}$</li>
					<li>The resulting angle is coterminal with ${\angle \phi.}$</li>
				</ol>

	<section id="determining_arc_length">
		<h4>Determining Arc Length</h4>
		<p>In the discussion on radians, we saw that with radian measure of some ${\angle \theta,}$ there exists an arc of length ${s}$ that subtends ${\angle \theta.}$ We can more formally define this relationship as such:</p>

		<figure class="math-display">
			<div class="rule">
				<p><span class="topic">Definition.</span> Suppose a circle with a radius of length ${r.}$ Suppose further that there exists an ${\angle \beta}$ whose vertex is the <span class="italicsText">center</span> of the circle:</p>
				<figure><img src="images/arc_length_measure.svg" alt="arc length" class="fifty-p" loading="lazy"></figure>
				<p>Then the length of the arc ${s}$ subtended by ${\angle \beta}$ with measure ${\theta}$ in radians is:</p>
				<figure class="math-display">
					<div>
						<p>${s = r \theta}$</p>
					</div>
				</figure>
			</div>
		</figure>

		<p>From the above definition, we can use the following algorithm to determine the length of an arc:</p>
		<figure class="math-display">
			<div class="rule">
				<p><span class="topic">Algorithm.</span> Let ${x}$ be a circle of radius ${r.}$ To determine the length ${s}$ of an arc subtended by an angle of measure ${\theta:}$</p>

					<li>Multiply the radius ${r}$ by the radian measure of ${\theta:}$ ${s = r \theta.}$</li>

		<h4>Determining the Area of a Sector</h4>
		<p>Now that we know how to compute arc length, we can use this knowledge to compute the area of a <span class="term">sector</span> of a circle. A sector is a region of a circle bound by two radii and and the subtending arc. In other words, the formal term for a slice of pizza is a pizza sector (assuming the pizza is circular and the pizza is sliced traditionally). Each side of the slice is a radius of length ${r,}$ and the crust is an arc of length ${s.}$</p>
